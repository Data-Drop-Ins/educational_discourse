Policy
 
on Postgraduate Research Student 
employment in teaching at UEA
 
 
Preamble
 
 
Postgraduate research
 
students 
play an important role in the delivery of
 
teaching 
at
 
UEA, to the benefit of taught 
programme 
students
,
 
the 
research 
students 
themselve
s, 
and the University.  
 
 
For taught undergraduate and postgraduate students, 
p
ostgraduate research 
students
 
broaden the range of expertise available to provide h
igh quality education
 
and
 
can add a diversity of approaches to teaching
.
 
Research students
 
can 
provide 
capacity that allows more small group and practical teaching and they can bring new 
research 
material and insights 
into the course.
 
 
For the 
research students
 
themselves,
 
the experience of teaching develops their 
skills, strengthens their CVs and p
rovides an opportunity for taught 
programme 
students to provide input into their research. 
 
 
For UEA, 
p
ostgraduate research students
 
provide teaching capacity, a greater range 
of skills and additional flexibility to our academic programmes.
 
 
The importance of 
p
ostgraduate research
 
teaching is highlighted in the 
NUS/U
CU
 
Charter on P
ostgraduate Employment
.
 
This 
UEA 
policy draws upon the Charter.
 
 
The University recognises the importance of 
postgraduate research
 
employment.  
UEA is committed to ensuring that the organisation of 
postgraduate research
 
teaching should ensure that:
 
1.
 
Postgraduate research students
 
themselves are competent in the subject 
area and appropriately trained;
 
2.
 
The allocation of teaching is unde
rtaken in a manner that is fair and 
transparent;
 
3.
 
The allocation of time, and thus payment, for 
p
ostgraduate research
 
teaching 
reflects in a fair manner the time demands of the role.
 
 
To this end, the UEA policy on 
p
ostgraduate research
 
teaching consists of
 
the 
following key elements. Note that in this policy the term 
teaching
 
is used to include all 
educational activities including preparation, demonstrating, 
lecturing
, 
seminar 
delivery
, assessment and administration.
 
 
 
Part A: 
Recruitment, Appointment and 
Employment Rights
 
 
1.
 
Fair and equal appointment procedures
 
Opportunities to teach on undergraduate and postgraduate courses should

research 
students to apply for the role.
 
This ma
y be done in bulk (e.g. for all 
opportunities within a School) rather than on an individual basis. 
The role 
description should include 
any preconditions for 
the role
.
 
Successful 
applicants should receive a contract stating 
the working hours;
 
the 
amount 
of 
pay; the timing at which payment will be made; 
provision for sickness and 
holiday leave.
 
Where teaching forms part of a bursary or scholarship, there 
must be transparency in terms of expectation and reward.
 
 
2.
 
A fair rate of pay
 
P
ayment 
for 
p
ostgraduate research students
 
undertaking teaching roles 
will 
be in accordance with 
Associate Tutor
 
pay rates
. 
Where 
pay rates 
include 
recognition 
of time spent in preparation 
or marking
 
this should be indicated. 
Contracted hours for each activity undertaken should reflect a 
reasonable 
average for 
that 
discipline
. 
Any variance from 
standard Associate Tutor rates
 
will be clearly articulated
.
 
Guidance is available from 
the Payroll Office
 
on 
tax
 
and other deductions
 
and, for international students, how National Insurance 
numbers are obtained.
 
 
 
3.
 
Representation wit
hin 
UEA
 
and by a 
trade union
 
Postgraduate research students
 
who
 
teach should have representation on

staff liaison 
groups at department

and faculty level. 
Postgraduate research 
students
 
have the right to be an active member of a recognised trade union 
and to be represented by that union to their institution.
 
At UEA the recognised 
union for Associate Tutors is UCU.
 
 
 
 
Part B: 
Management, Training and Support

Induction and 
initial training
 
All 
p
ostgraduate research students
 
who teach should have completed

who teach should 
also 
be provided
 
by their School
 
with an induction that introduces:
 
 

 
Teaching structures at UEA
 

 
The teaching approach being used in the module and course
 

 
The subject to be taught
 

 
The course materials

should be provided with appropriate levels of 
mentoring and supervision by an appropriately
 
qualified staff member who is 
not 
on their supervisory team
, normally the 
module organiser or course 
director
.
 
All 
p
ostgraduate research students
 
who teach
 
should have access to 
a suitably qualified single academic point of contact with whom they 
should 
be able to rais
e issues
 
and seek advice
. This individual could 
provide an

6.
 
Feedback on performance and progress
 
Postgraduate research students
 
should be provided with feedback on their 
performance, areas that need improvement and their progress both formally 
and informally. Where appropriate this should include both student
 
feedback
 
and that from
 
a more senior academic manager
 
or mentor who has 
had the 
opportunity to observe the
 
postgraduate teaching.
 
 
7.
 
Resources to support teaching
 
Access to the necessary facilities and resources required to undertake the 
role. These could include printing and photocopying, use of teaching rooms, 
stationery and equipment, office space, a storage facility and access 
to online 
learning environments
.
 
 
8.
 
The availability of appropriate continuing professional development 
 
Students should have access to appropriate continuing professional 
development, delivered 
by CSED
 
or within their re
searcher development 
programme
. Development opportunities should include the development of 
specific teaching skills such as lecturing or teaching students with specific 
support needs; introduction to pedagogic theories; or opportunities to 
undertake an ac
credited course in teaching in higher education.  
 
 
 
 
Part C: 
Career Development
 
 
9.
 
A
cademic
 
culture
 
Postgraduate research students
 
who teach
 
should be
 
included in appropriate 
activities
 
on an equal basis with academic colleagues
,
 
and 
sho
uld
 
receive 
opportunities to engage as professionals
 
with the teaching culture 
of their 
School, including for example being eligible for teaching awards.
 
 
10.
 
The balance
 
between
 
employment and research 
 
Care must 
be taken to ensure 
that employment 
in teaching 
does not take 
precedence
 
over 
the 
research 
in which the postgraduate is engaged, leading 
to a delay in submission for the degree award.
 
Full

time registered research 
degree c
andidates are not normally expected to undertake more than an 
average of 6 hours paid employment per week, up to a maximum of 180 
hours per academic year. Candidates should seek the approval of their 
supervisory team for any paid work undertaken, and must 
take responsibility 
for fully complying with
 
any 
visa restrictions placed on employment.
