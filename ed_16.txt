Background
 
 
The University Senate agreed on 25 June 2003 to class 
research degree candidates
 
as Category A and Category B 
candidates
, rather than as staff and non
-
staff 
candidates. The rationale behind this was to 

 
quality assurance issue 
from the contractual nature of the relationship between the student and UEA or 

The definition was that 

the University or Institute
.

 
 
The Regulations for the PhD and othe
r research degrees state that 


such other candidates as Senate shall determine) or Category B.

 
 
 
Section 
6
 
of the 
Code of Practice for Research Degrees
 
(page 
11
) states that 
"The 
admission, registration, annual review and examination of candidates who are 
members of the University's a
cademic staff or research staff at an affiliated Graduate 
School

The Affiliated Graduate Schools are currently the Norwich Bioscience Institutes (NBI) Graduate 
School and the University of Suffolk Graduate School.

The categorisation of 
candidates
 
as Category A ensures that consideration of these 
candidates
' progress is undertaken
 
outside the School, separate from any staff 
management considerations or perceptions of unfair advantage or bias. Also it 
means that any academic decisions taken, for example, to confirm the passing or not 
of probation, or to award the degree
 
concerned
 
ar
e subject to independent review 
from outside the School. 
 
 
Categorisation as Category A means that any changes to a 
candidate

will need to be approved by the 
Academic Director of UEA Doctoral College
 
and 
annual progress 
and probationary 
revi
ew forms will be considered by the relevant 
Graduate School Executive rather than at School level.
 
 
The classification of 
research degree candidates
 
as Category A or Category B was 
reviewed in 2010
-
11, and Appendix A of the 
Code of Practice for Research Degrees
 
was amended to provide greater clarity on which categories of staff were included or 
excluded from the definition of Ca
tegory A. 
 
 

of its regulatory framework, and revised guidelines are set out below.

Classification of 
research degree candidates
 
as Category A and 
Category B
 
 
The classi
fication of 
research degree candidates
 
as Category A or Category B should 
be made at the point of admission, 
the date of submission of the Application for 
Approval of Thesis Title and Examiners form 
and reviewed at each annual review of 
progress.
 
 
 
If regi
stered for a research degree
,
 
t
he following groups of staff will 
always
 
be 
considered as Category A:
 
 

 
All academic staff 
(ATS and ATR) 
whether from within or outside the School 
of Study
, whether part
-
time or full
-
time or on fixed term or indefinite contrac
ts. 
 

 
Research Associates or Technical staff based in the School of Study or 
UEA 
Research Centres
3
 
associated with the School of Study
.
 

 
Research staff
2
 
at an affiliated Graduate School
1
 
and based as a 
research 
degree candidate 
at that affiliated 
Graduate School
.
 
 
The following categories of staff will be considered as Category B unless there is 
actual or possible perceived conflict of interest, in which case they will be considered 
as Category A:
 
 

 
Administrative staff employed at the University, o
r at Academic Partners or 
affiliated Institutes
3
.
 

 
Associate Tutors or Demonstrators employed by the University, Academic 
Partners or affiliated Institutes

.

This includes academic staff and Research Associates.

rtners and UEA Research Centres can be found in

Academic 
Partners

excepting those based as a 
research degree candidate
 
at the affiliated Graduate School where employed
 
(as above).
 

 
Academic staff
 
at Academic Partners
3
, excepting those at affiliated Graduate 
Schools (as above).
 
 
Members of staff have the respons
ibility of identifying potential conflicts of interest.
 
 
The above lists are not exhaustive and in some circumstances it may be appropriate, 
due to a possible perception of conflict of interest, for other 
candidates
 
to be 
classified
 
on an individual basis 
as Category A. In particular this may apply to near 
relatives
4
 
of UEA staff members.
 
 
IMPORTANT NOTE:
 
All members of staff and near relatives of staff must complete a 
Staff Candidate Admission form prior to admission, regardless of whether they are 
classi
fied at that point as Category A or Category B.
 
 
4.
 
Review of Category A or B status
 
 
If 
research degree candidates
 
gain or leave employment at UEA during their 
P
eriod 
of 
R
egistration 
or the nature of their employment changes, consideration should be 
given at
 
that point as to whether their classification as Category A or Category B 
candidates
 
should be amended.
 
 
 
Candidates
 
should 
notify 
the Postgraduate Research Service
 
of
 
any changes
 
to 
their 
employment 
status
 
(e.g. gaining or leaving qualifying employment at UEA).
 
 
5.
 
Examinat
ion
 
 
The above rules for determining whether a candidate should be considered as 
Category A also apply to the examination process, noting that the examination of 
Category A candidates must be conducted exclusively by external examiners. 
 
 
The following 
can
didates
 
should also be considered as Category A for the purposes 
of examination:
 
 

 
The following candidates who have left the University in the 12 months 
preceding the date of submission of the Application for Approval of Thesis 
Title and Examiners 
form:
 
 

 
UEA members of academic staff
.
 
 

 
Research Associates or Technical staff based in the School of Study 
or allied Research Centres.
 

 
Research staff at an affiliated Graduate School
1
.
 
 

 
Candidates who will be appointed as members of UEA academic staff with
in 
six months of the viva.

The University considers that spouses, partners, children, parents, uncles, aunts, nieces, nephews, 
those considered next of kin, and grandchildren of members of staff may be regarded as near relatives.

The following candidates may be considered as Category A in certain circumstances:
 
 

 
Near relatives of UEA staff members
4
.
 

 
Any other candidates who were classified during their studies as Category A 
but who left the University in
 
the last 12 months.
 
 
The overarching principle in determining whether a 
research degree candidate
 
should be classified as Category A for the purposes of examination is to consider 
whether 
it might appear to an outside person 
that there is any real or perc
eived 
conflict of interest 
or that 
the University has
 
a vested interest in the outcome
 
of the 
examination
.
 
In such circumstances the candidate should be classified as Category 
A to 
ensure th
at 
the examination process
 
clearly demonstrates 
integrity and 
independence
.
