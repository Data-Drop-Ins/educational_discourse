INTRODUCTION
 
 
1.
 
Aim of the Code o
f
 
Practice
 
 
This Code of Practice provides a framework of procedures and practices to support 
research 
degree candidate
s and their supervisors, and to assist UEA in achieving its 
str
ategic commitments. Application of the 
key principles
 
(
see section 4
) 
is mandatory. 
The 
Code is accompanied by a series of 
Research Degree Policy Documents
, which 
set out in greater
 
detail 
some 
of the policies and procedures referred to in this 
document
 
(
see Appendix B
)
.
 
 
2.
 
Framework for Quality Assurance of Research Degrees at UEA
 
 
The 

Learning and Teaching Committee (LTC)
 
is r
esponsible to the 
Senate for 
ensuring 
and enhancing 

 
It does so within a
 
formal framework in which the 
Doctoral College
 
Executive makes 
decisions relating to postgraduate research programmes and then
 
reports 
to
 
the 
LTC
.
 
 
 
The 
Doctoral College
 
Executive is chaired by the Pro Vice Chancellor (Research
 
and 
Innovation
)
 
and
 
involves the 
Academic Director of 
UEA Doctoral College
 
(Vice
-
Chair)
 
and 
Faculty Associate Deans for Postgraduate Research
. 
Professional 
support is 
provided 
by the 
Postgraduate Research Service
.
 
C
onsiderable authority and 
responsibility for 
the 
management of 
res
earch degrees 
is delegated 
to Faculties, 
Affiliated Graduate Schools
1
,
 
Schools and Institutes
2
.
 
 
P
olicies and procedures relating to research degrees at UEA are 
also 
set out in the 
R
egula
tions
 
for research degrees and 
Instructions to E
xaminers
. Additional
 
information and
 
guidance regarding policy and procedure 
in relation to research 
degrees at UEA 
is 
available from
 
the Postgraduate 
Research
 
Service
.
 
 
3.
 
Research Degrees 
 
 
The 
Higher Education Statistics Agency
 
(HESA)
 
defines 
a research degree as 
follows
:
 
 
A research
-
based higher degree is a postgraduate programme comprising a 
research component (
including a requirement to produce original work) that is 
larger than any accompanying taught component when measured by student 
effort.
 
 
 
1
 
Graduate Schools that are currently affiliated are the Norwich Bioscie
nce Institutes (NBI) Graduate School and 
the University of Suffolk Graduate 
Sc
hool.
 
2
 
The use of the term Institutes in th
is document refers to 
the John Innes Centre, The Sainsbury Laboratory
, 
the 
Earlham Institute
 
and
 
the Quadram Institute Bioscience

All r
esearch 
degrees must
 
follow this pattern and 
abide by 
the 
Quality Assurance 
Agency (
QAA
)
 
UK 
Quality 
Code
 
for Higher Education
: 
Advice and Guidance 
Research Degrees
. In addition, the taught components of 
professional doctorates
 
(
ClinPsyD
, 
EdPsyD
, 
ProfD
 
and 
EdD
) 
are managed and reviewed in accordance with
 
management of and reviews for similar provision for postgraduate taught students
. 
 
 
The v

Masters by Research

and MSc
 
by Research) are 
research degre
es
, assessed by an oral examination of the thesis
. 
 
 
From 2017/18, the Master of Research (MRes) degree also meets the 
HESA 
definition for a research degree (with 80 credits of taught element and 100 credits of 
research dissertation element). The MRes is 
g
overned by the 
Common Masters 
Framework
 
Regulations
 

Learning and 
Teaching Service
, with admissions supported by the 
Postgraduate Taught 
Admissions team
 
in the Admissions, Recruitment and Marketing Division.

Key Principles for Research Degree Supervision
 
 
The following principles 
must 
be followed:
 
 
School
s and Institutes
 
should:
 
 

 
e
nsure
 
that t
he admissions process 
is 
handled in a fair and consistent manner, in 
line with equal 
opportunities
,
 
U
niversity
 
polic
ies
 
and the 
PGR Admissions 
Framework
, 
and 
that there is 

 
undertake a research degree, including 
English language prof
iciency
, before any 
offer is made
. 
 
 

 
ensure
 
that s
tudents 
(hereafter referred to as research degree candidates)
 
know 
where to find 
the 
R
egulations
 
and procedures for the research degree for which 
they are registered as well as more general student regulations and procedures. 
 
 

 
provide
 
research degree candidates 
with 
clear and
 
accurate information about 
their entitlement
s,
 
and what is 
require
d
 
and expect
ed of them, 
as well as 
appropriate information about the academic and social environment of the 
University.  
 
 

 
provide
 
research degree candidates 
with 
information about assessme
nt 
processes and procedures.   
 
 

 
e
nsure that 
each 
research degree candidate
 
has a supervisory team 
comprising a 
minimum of two research active teachers
 
(see footnote 
9
 
in Section 
8b)
 
for the 

, one of whom is designated the primary s
upervisor
.
 
 

 
ensure
 
con
tinuity of supervision 
and for making appropriate arrangements to 
provide supervisory cover in the event of staff absence.
 
 

 
m
onitor the quality of supervision and ensure that any problems that are identified 
are dealt with in a timely
 
manner
.

esignate
 
a senior member of staff w
ho is responsible, in the first instance, for 
helping to resolve conflicts around supervision.
 
 

 
c
ollect 
research degree candidate
 
feedback on the quality of supervision and 
learning resources and use
 
it

e
nsure that 
formal reviews of s
tudent progress take place, including a formal 
report by the supervisory team and the 
research degree candidate
 
completed
 
on 
an annual basis.
 
 
 
Supervisors should:
 
 

 
t
ake responsibility for ensuring that they receive 
appropriate training 
in relation to 
their supervisory role 
and 
attend continuing professional development sessions 
every three years in order to continue supervi
sing.
 
 

 
respond t
o

research degree candida
te

s
 
written work in a timely manner. 
 
R
esearch degree candidates
 
should: 
 
 

 
either 
undertake 10 
Personal and Professional Development (PPD)
 
training 
credits per year (
pro rata 
for part
-
time 
candidates
) 
or
 
comply with a 
Training 
P
athway
, 
as specified by their Faculty, Graduate School or Institute
.
 
Compliance 
with a Training P
athw
ay is required for candidates registering on 
or after 1 
October 2017.
 
 

 
familiarise
 
themselves with the 
R
egulations
 
an
d procedures for the research 
degree for whic
h they are registered as well as more general student regulations 
and procedures
.
 
 

 
keep a record of supervisory meetings and the advice of their supervisors.
 
 

 
be aware that they have the right, if necessary, to 
request a change to their 
primary supervisor 
or any other member of their supervisory team. 
Such a 
request will normally be met (insofar as it is practicable and any contracted terms 
and conditions allow).
 
 
R
esearch degree candidates
 
and supervisors should
: 
 
 

 
treat 
s
upervision 
as 
a professional relat
ionship
, 
guided by principles of intellectual 
and interpersonal integrity, fairness, respect, clarity about roles and 
responsibilities, student autonomy and working in the best interests of the 
research degree c
andidate
.
  
 
 

 
maintain
 
sufficient 
regular cont
act to inform and monitor the progress of the 
research.  For full
-
time 
candidates
 
this should include a minimum of eight 
supervisory meetings per year (including three formal progress
 
review meetings). 
For part
-
time 
candidates
 
this should include a minimum
 
of four supervisory 
meetings per year (including two progress review meetings).

Institutes should ensure that adequate mechanisms are in 
place for monitoring the accuracy of information in pre
-
admission and promotional 
materials. 
 
 
b)
 
Requirements for Admission
 
 
The 
Regulations
 
for research degrees set out the admissions requirements for 
candidates. 
 
 
Admission of candidates who are members of staff or candi
dates who are relatives of

c)
 
Admission Processes
 
 
Each 
Faculty
 
must have 
approved admission procedures 
which:
 
 

 
ensure that only appropriately qualified and/or prepared 
candidates 
are admitted 
onto research programmes;
 

 
include
, 
where appropriate, 
mechanisms for assessing 
c
andidate

professional or other work experience where a 
prospective 
candidate
 
lacks a first degree and/or a taught postgraduate award; 
 

 
ensure that applicants with disabi
lities are not disadvantaged 
n
or debarred by 
the 
criteria and procedures used for selecting 
research degree candidates
, that 
appropriate support is offered and available at any interview and that
,
 
for 
applicants with disabilities who are offered a place
,
 
a
ny support needs are 
identified in a timely a
nd effective way;
 

 
ensure that the topic identified is appropriate for a research degree, that a 
sufficient level and volume of expertise is available (both internal and external to 
the University) to support and
 
assess the 
candidate
, and that sufficient fa
cilities 
and resources are available to ensure the project can be completed in a timely 
fashion;
 

 
beyond the basic screening of applications, involve the judgement of more than 
one member of research
-
active acade
mic staff with relevant expertise in making 
a
dmissions decisions;
 

 
ensure that references are taken up and 
used
 
in the admissions decision
.
 
 
d)
 
English Language Requirements and Equivalency of Qualifications

r
esearch 
d
egree 
c
andidate
 
and 
Faculty, 
School 
or Institute each
 
have a responsibility to adhere to the original intent of the agreed 
offer of admission
.
 
 
 
2.
 
Approval of Research Projects
 
 
a)
 
Prior to Admission
 
 
A sufficiently clear outline of the proposal should be agreed with the 
research degree 
candidate
 
prior to admissi
on to ensure that the School or Institute can satisfy itself 
that: 
 

 
there is appropriate
 
e
xpertise available to the School or Institute to supervise and 
assess the 
candidate
; 
 

 
there are appropriate facilities and sufficient resources available to enable th
e 
candidate
 
to carry out their work; 
 

 
there will be sufficient related research activity
 
i
n the School or Institute to provide 
a demonstrably research
-
active environment for the 
candidate
; 
and
 

 
the proposal is a suitable basis for embarking on a research de
gree project. 
 
 
b)
 
Following Registration
 
 
As part of the induction process, there will be 
a
n
 
Initial M
eeting between the 
research 
degree candidate
 
and the primary supervisor 
within three weeks of registration
 
at 
which 
the p
roposed 
P
robationary 
R
eview panel

identified.
 
The role of the supervisory team members 
and 
their
 
p
ercentage weighting 
should be clarified at this meeting.
 
 
It is the joint responsibility of the 
candidate
 
and the supervisory team to agree
 
at the 
Initial Meeting
 
the
 
research topic
, 
a provisional working title that is appropriate to the 
degree
, the work
in
g objectives of the project and a timetable of activity over the 
P
eriod of 
S
tudy
.
 
The candidate and supervisory team should also discuss any ethical 
approval requirem
ents for the research project at the Initial Meeting.
 
 
A training needs analysis meeting
 
s
hould be held within 8 weeks of initial registration 
and should involve 
the candidate
 
and at least two members of 
their supervisory 
team. Where a candidate intends to
 
comply with a 
Training Pathway
, t
he results of 
this a
nalysis, along with the relevant Training Pathway documentation, should be 
used to prepa
re
 
an initial 
Personal Development Plan
 
following this template whi
ch
 
will be reviewed throughout 

 
registration period, including at every 
Annual Progre
ss
 
Review meeting
. The first Annual Progress Review meeting 
normally occurs in the eighth month after initial registration
 
for full
-
time students or 
the twentieth mont

Health and Safety Information 
 
 
Where advanced study and research involves the 
research degree candidate
 
in 
potentially 
hazardous environments within the University and/or the Institutes, such 
as a laboratory
, 
the School or Institute must ensure that the 
candidate
 
receives 
formal instruction about health and safety implications, rules and requirements before 
the 
candidate
 
s
tarts work in that environment.
 
 
The School or Institute must record that health and saf
et
y training has been provided 
in the annual report on the 
candidate

or 
placements are
 
undertaken, a risk assessment must b
e carried out and the School or 
Institute must arrange for appropriate training and advi
ce
 
to be provided on the 
potential pro
blems and dangers of such work.
 
The responsibility for giving training 
and advice to the 
research degree candidate
 
may be delegate
d by the School or 
Institute to the supervisory team. 
 
 
5.
 
Ethics and Research Integrity
 
 
 
Al
l staff and students have a responsibility to observe the highest standards of 
conduct in their research
 
and r
esearch degree candidates should discuss research

T

Supervisor Relationship
 
 
The relationship between a 
research degree cand
idate
 
and th
eir supervisory team, 
and in particular their primary supervisor, is 
importa
nt
 
to the successful and 
satisfactory progress of a 
candidate.
 
It is important that the relationship allows 
supervisors and 
candidates
 
to be able to 
criticise each othe

 
con
structively
. 
 
 
A 
summary of advice of good practice for 
research degree cand
id
ates 
and their 
supervisors 
is 
contained in
 
Research Degree Policy Document 7 


.
 
 
 
b)
 
Appointment of Supervisory Teams
 
 
T
he 
Head
 
of the School or the 
Chair of the NBI Graduate S
chool Executive
 
is 
responsible for the appointment of supervisors. Each 
research degree candidate
 
must have a 
nominated su
pervisory team of at least two research
-
active
8
 
teachers
9
 
in 
the University.
 
T
he membership of supervisory teams of those who are not defined 
as a teacher in the University will 
only 
be with the approval of the 
Academic 
Director 
of 
UEA Doctoral
 
College
. 
 
 
Primary supervisors will normally have gained a doctoral degree, or have equ
iv
alent 
experience of research, and must be active researchers.
 
 
There may be a
n existing agreement at institutional level between UEA and the 

e institutio
n
 
regarding 
supervision of UEA research 
degree candidates
. Where this is not
 
t
he case, i
f a School or Institute seeks to 
appoint 
an external
 
supervisor
,
 
including holders of honorary appointments
,
 
who has 
not acted previously in this capacity a
t 
the Univer
sity
, a form (covering issues such 
as 
the 
supervisory experience and trainin
g 
of
 
t
he proposed supervisor)
 
must be 
submitted to
 
the 
Academic 
Director of 
UEA Doctoral College
.  If the proposal is 
accepted, a memorandum of understanding 
detailing 
the level an
d nature of 
supervision which the
 
supervisor
 
is
 
expected to contribute (and 
an
y associated 
payment)
 
must then be signed by the appointee on taking up the position.
 
Wherever 
such arrangements constitute part of the formal supervision of the rese
arch degree 
candidate, they should be contractually enforceable.
 
 
External supervisors, 
in
cluding h
olders of Honorary appointments
,
 
may only be 
appointed as primary supervisors with the prior permission of the
 
Academic
 
Director 
of

Th
e role of th
e supervisory team is, collectively, to provide candidates for research 
degr
ee
s with academic and pastoral guidance as they pursue advanced study and 
research. The potential for conflict of interest, either between members of the 
supervisory te
am or betwee
n the team and the 
candidate
, should be considered 
before appointments are m
ad
e. 
 
 
Fixed
-
term contract research staff 
may be members of supervisory teams but they 
may not be primary supervisors without the prior permission of the 
Academic 
Direc
tor 
of 
UEA D
octoral College
.
 
 
c)
 
Role of 
primary supervisor
 
 
 
The primary supervisor 
is res
po
nsible
 
for the overall management and direction of 
the 
research degree candidate

 
in addition to issues relating to the 
candidate
's registration and progress.
 
 
 
The prima
ry supervisor will 
normally 
have a contracted period of service at
 
least as 
lo
ng as the expected Period of R
egistration of the 
candidate
. The primary supervisor 
will be the line of communication with the University. 
 
 

ame must be 
notified in writing to the 
research degree 
candidate
 
in 
the offer letter 
for
 
t
he degree in question.
 
 
 
d)
 
Roles of 
other s
upervisory 
t
eam members
 
 
 
The second supervisor (and in some cases additional supervisory team members) 
will be appointed to 
contribute t
heir specific expertise in assisting the primary 
supervisor throughout the d
ev
elopment of the 
research degree candidate

degree.  The second supervisor may be required to offer specialist advice, but whilst 
they should be knowledgeabl
e in the are
a of research study, they are not required to 
have the specialist subject ex
pe
rtise of the primary supervisor. 
 
 
Membership of a supervisory team may change depending on the direction taken by 
the research project. When creating a new team or c
onsidering a
ny changes to a 
supervisory team, it may be helpful to consider the gender b
al
ance of the team. 
Requests to add a team member where existing 
research degree candidate
s
 
or 
supervisors wish to create a more diverse team should be supported where 
appropriate.

versity and membership of the 
Athena SWAN Charter
.
 
 
 
Members of a supervisory team are not expect
ed to meet a
 
candidate
 
with the same 
frequency as the 
primary
 
supervisor, nor are they e
xp
ected to read all of the 
candidate

candidate
 
a minimum of three 
times per year. 
 
 
The balance of responsibility for the 
cand
idate

day supervision should be 
negotiated between supervisors, in consultation
 
w

candidate

Ext
ernal supervisors / collaborating supervisors
 
 
In some circumstances it may 
be
 
appropriate to appoint an external supervisor, for 
example, for collaborations with
in 
Doctoral T
ra
ining Partnerships
 
or with
 
industry
 
partners,
 
or where a current supervisor has left the University. The primary 
supervisor should however be based at the University
; exceptions
 
to this will require 
the approval of the 
Academic 
Director of 
UEA Doctoral 
Co
llege
. External supervisors 
are expected to have comparable research experience and should fulfil the same 
selection criteria that are applied to the appointment of s
upervisors a
t the University.
 
 
Where a formal collaborative research degree arrangement 
ha
s been approved 
between the University and an external institution, supervisors must be appointed at 
both institutions. The collaborating supervisor should take respo
nsibility fo
r the day

to
-
day supervision of the research 
degree candidate
 
and their rese
ar

programme 
whilst they are in attendance at the external organisation.

Mentoring and Support for Supervisors
 
 
M
embers of staff in their 
probationary period
 
of appo

not normally be 
appointed as a primary supervisor. The

supervision prior to appointment to supervise in their first year o
f appointmen
t. 
 
 
It is expected that members of staff new to doctoral supervision will f
ir
st engage in 
supervision as a second supervisor or a member of a supervisory team, before 
moving on after a sufficient period of experience to primary supervision.
 
 
A
 
member of s
taff should not normally act as primary supervisor to more than six 
research
 
d
egree candidate
 
at the same time, and never more than ten without the 
prior permission of their Faculty Associate Dean. Any member of staff wishing to act 
as primary 
supervisor t
o more than six 
research degree candidate
s
 
(up to the 
maximum of ten), must 
ha
ve the written permission of their Head of School or 
Director of the Institute
 
who is responsible for making sure that the member of staff 
concerned is not overburden
ed by other 
duties. 
 
 
The Head of the School or Director of the Institute is responsible
 
f
or ensuring that 
new members of staff who are members of supervisory teams are identified for 
support and, that existing members of staff who are in need of support, 
or whose 
sup
ervisory load needs to be adjusted, are identified through the annual review

Supervisor training
 
 
All newly
-
appointed members 
of staff
 
with responsibility for super
vision, and 
existing 
members of staff taking on their first supervisory role, are requir
ed
 
to attend the 
appropriate
 
programme of development for new supervisors.

In order to continue supervising research 
degree 
candidate
s,
 
e
xperienced 
supervisors are ex
pected to at
tend continuing professional development sessions in 
relation to their super
vi
sory role 
every three years.
 
 
h)
 
 
Absence and Departure of Supervisors
 
 
Any absence of the primary supervisor longer than eight weeks
,
 
or
 
any case of a 
shorter absence w
here the rea
dy availability of supervision
 
could be in doubt,
 
must 
be dealt with by the 
Sc
hool or Institute in a timely manner.
 
 
The School or Institute must establish whether or not the supervisor will be able to 
communicate effectively and appropriately 
with the 
res
earch degree candidate
 
during 
the period of any absence. If this cannot be g
ua
ranteed
,
 
a temporary or new primary 
supervisor will be appointed, such appointment to be formally approved and recorded 
via the School

s
 

 
usual mechani
sms, and the
 
candidate
 
should be 
notified in writing of the name of the person appointed
. 
In the case of a primary 
supervisor being on study leave and unavailable to continue supervision, a temporary 
or new primary supervisor should always be appointed. Th
e 
candidate
 
will be 
informed and notified in writing by their School or Institute prior 
to
 
the absence of the 
primary supervisor. 
 
 
If a primary supervisor leaves the University, a new primary supervisor will normally 
be appointed. In exceptional circumsta
nces (e.g. w
here a 
research degree candidate
 
is near the end of their 
P
eriod of 
S
tudy or
 
t
here is not a suitably qualified primary 
supervisor available) when the 
Head
 
of the School or 
Chair of NBI 
Graduate S
chool 
Executive
 
decides that it is in the best in
terests of a
ll involved for the departing 
primary supervisor to remain on the supervisor
y 
team, the composition of the 
supervisory team should be reviewed in accordance with the policies set out above 
for the composition of supervisory teams, and for appoi
ntment and c
ontracting of 
external supervisors.
 
 
In instances where there is to be a cha
ng
e in primary supervisor, whatever the time 
period involved, proper handover arrangements should be in place. 
 
 
i)
 
Extent of Supervision
 
 
A distinction should be made bet
ween informa
l 
contact 
and supervisory meetings. 
Informal contact 
may
 
include emails, 
imp
ro
mptu 
discussions or brief telephone 
conversations about specific issues. Whilst invaluable in maintaining contact with a 
research degree candidate
 
these do not consti
tute formal 
supervision. Supervisory 
meetings should be scheduled, uninterrupted time in
 
a
n appropriate environment.
 
 
 
The frequency, purpose and method of arranging 
supervisory
 
meetings and other 
communications should be agreed by the supervisory team and
 
research de
gree 
candidate
, and these arrangements should be kept under review. 
 
 
Notes 
of
 
actions agreed between the supervisory team and 
candidate
 
must be kept 
to info
rm the annual review of student
s

 
progress
 
(
see a
lso 
Section 
9
)
. 
The dates of 
supervisory meetings should be recorded on the annual revi
ew
 
of progress forms.

Frequency of Supervision
 
 
The frequency of supervisory meetings will be determined by the nature of the 
research that is undertaken and the stag
e of develop
ment of the 
research degree 
candidate

s research but a normal expectation wo
ul
d be for such meetings to take 
place every month for full

time 
candidates
. All disciplines should, however, expect 
full

time 
candidates
 
to meet with their supervisors
 
at least ei
ght times per 
year
 
-
 
including formal progress review meetings (
see Section 
9
).
 
 
 
The meeting schedule for part time 
candidates
 
should be agreed at the beginning of 
the degree, but 
candidates
 
registered on
 
a part time
 
basis 
are expected
 
to meet with 
their supervisor 
at least four times per ye
ar
, including formal progress review 
meetings. 
 
 
T
here will be an
 
an

G
uidance and Feedback
 
 
The primary supervisor should arrange a meeting with the 
research degree candidate
 
to establish the working relationship within three weeks of r
egistration.
 
This should 
include agreeing responsibilities and expectations as well as c
la
rifying critical 
activities and dates. The 
candidate
 
is the person responsible for conducting the 
research and writing the thesis. 
 
 
The primary supervisor and other 
members of t
he supervisory team are expected to 
offer advice and guidance
 
regularly
, and
 
t
o discuss the skills and employability 
training courses that the 
candidate
 
should attend.
 
The role of the supervisory team 
members should also be clarified at this me

Resolving Problems affecting Supervision
 
 
At
 
a
ny time in 
their
 
research degree registration, a 
research degree candidate
 
may 
request a change of a member of the supervisory team, including the primary 
supervisor.
 
Such a requ
est will normally be met (insofar as it is practicable and any 
contracted te
rm
s and conditions allow), though the decision to make such a change 
should not be taken lightly. Informal means of resolving problems (
see 
Section 1
4
) 
must have been exhausted and possible effects on study should b
e 
considered. If a 
change is to be requested, the 
candidate
 
should inform the School
/Institute
 
Director 
of 
Postgraduate Research 
of the School
/Institute
 
in which 
they a
re
 
registere
d, which 
will start the process.
 
Where 
the School/Institute Director of Post
gr
aduate Research
 
is a member of the supervisory team candidates should discuss their concerns with 
the Head of School or Chair of the NBI Graduate School Executive
.
 
 
W
hile a 
candi
date
 
will be asked to indicate why they wish to make such a change, 
they wil
l 
not be required to 
put the reason
 
on the record (the reason can be supplied 
confidentially to the 
Academic 
Director of 
UEA Doctoral College
) and no formal 
record will
 
be made of 
the reasons why such a change is requested. Procedures for 
lodging a formal 
co
mplaint regarding supervisory arrangements 
can be found 
on the 
PGR Service webpages

complete the online
 
annual re
view process
 
each year including during any 
research degree candidate

R
egistration
-
O
n
ly
 
P
eriod (for some professional doctorates this requirement 
commences with the research project).
 
 
The 
core elements 
of the 
procedure for the management of progress of
 
a 
research 
degree candidate
 
are 
as follows: 
 
 

 
the process will involve a dialogue betwe
en
 
the supervisory team and 
candidate
 
and the report should be discussed between them before submission. The notes 
of action
s
 
agreed between the supervisory team and 
ca
ndidate
 
shou
ld be 
available to the 
candidate
 
and team to inform the annual review;
 

 
the d
ia
logue between the 
candidate
 
and supervisory team will focus upon specific 

effort 
to pinpoint 
weaknesses and deal with potential problems before they 
become intractable;
 

 
th
e process will include the 
candidate
 
completing an online
 
submission. This 

 
submission
 
will take the form of a self
-
evaluation of work undertaken, 
training
 
undertaken,
 
the development of intellectual skills, progress towards 
meeting research g
oa
ls and the success of the supervisory arrangements during 
the previous year;
 

 
the supervisory team will, having considered the 

 
submission, address 
the same
 
matters in 
its own written submission
;
 

 
the progress report is to include, in addition t
o 
the two written 
submissions
, a 
schedule for completion of the thesis agreed by the 
candidate
 
and supervisory 
team
;
 

 
research degree candidate
s
 
should be informed of th
eir right to
 
discuss their 
progress with the School or Institute designated responsible 
ac
ademic (such as a 
School
/Institute
 
Director of 
Postgraduate Research
)
 
in a private meeting.
 
 
During their first year of registration

f skills and
 
employability training for all 
research degree candidate
s
, taking into acco
un
t national standards including the 
Vitae
 
Researcher 
Development Framework
 
and the expectations of 
the 
Research 
Councils. All 
re
se
arch degree candidate
s
 
are expected to actively participate in the 
T
raining 
P
athway 
programmes
 
as specified by their Faculties, Graduate Schools or 
Institutes, and supervisors are expected to support their 
candidates
 
i
n developing
 
their personal skills and employability.
 
 
Failure to engage with the traini
ng
 
programmes provided and/or to accumulate the 
required 
PPD credi

per year 
or to 
comply with Training Pathway
 
requirements 
constitutes a breach of

Preparation and Submission of a Thesis
 
 
a)
 
Before Submitt
ing the Thes
is
 
 
Candidates for research degrees 
should always
 
consult their supervisory 
te
am 
before submitting a thesis for examination. However, within the limits to the timing of 
submissions set out in the 
R
egulations for their degree
, the decision about precisely 
when to submit rests with the 
candidate
.
 
 
The thesis title should normally be approved and the examiners 
appointed at
 
least 
three months before the thesis is submitted. The thesis title is appr
ov
ed by the 
School
/Institute
 
Director of 
Postgraduate Research
, and examiners are appointed by 
either the Faculty Associate Dean (Postgraduate Research) or equivalent
,
 
or 
the 
Acade
mic 
Director of 
UEA Doctoral College
. Appointment of examiners (

can be a lengthy process and delay in requesting the appointment of examiners may 
lead to delay in examination of the the
sis. 
 
 
b)
 
Rules
 
for the Form and Submission of Work
 
 
There is no single definition that can
 
a
dequately define the structure and content of a 
good thesis and general approval of the thesis by a supervisory team or primary 
supervisor should not be taken as a gu
arantee of i
ts acceptability to the examiners. 
There are, however, rules about the form 
an
d submission of the thesis
, including the 
use of work within the thesis which has formed part of solely and jointly authored 
publications.
 
These are set out in
 
Resear
ch Degree Po
licy Document 3 


. 
 
 
There are also 
Regulations
 
detailing the requirements for assessment attaching to 
particular postgraduate research awards. 
R
esearch degree candidate
s
 
shou

consult t
he appropriate 
Regulations
 
prior to preparation of their thesis.
 
 
Specified 
wo

-
limits exist for theses. These are published in the 
Regulations
 
for 
each degree
 
an
d candidates should consult these
 
to ensure that their thesis is not 
too long.
 
 
 
Specific 
Regulations
, published in the Calendar, apply to the submission of theses for 
some research degrees submitt
ed by candid
ates in 
the School of Literature

and Creative Writing (Creative and C
ri
tical Writing; 
Literary 
Translation) 
and 
the 
School of 
Art, Media and American
 
Studies
 
(
Professional Practice)
.
 
Candidates 
should refer any qu
eries regarding these sp
ecific R
egul
ations to their School in the 
first instance.
 
 
Candidates should initially s
ub
mit their thesis in electronic format and also submit 
two 
copies 
of the thesis in a secure soft binding sufficiently durable for the assessment 
process. The examiners
 
will be sen
t the thesis in 
soft

bound
 
format as standard but 
will 
be 
asked at appointme
nt
 
to notify the University if they would prefer to receive 
a 
copy of 
the thesis in 
electronic
 
format. The candidate should also bring a soft
-
bound 
copy of the thesis t
o the oral e
xamination for reference during the discussions.
 
 
No Pass List will be issue
d 
after successful assessment until the thesis has been 
resubmitted in the form outlined in 
Research Degree Policy Document 3 

Degrees: Submissi
on

 
and the 
candidate has confirmed that no changes, other than any required by the examiners, 
have been made to an
y part of th
e thesis from that previously assessed.
 
Where 
redaction of material from the
 
t
hesis has been approved by the University, a copy of 
the redacted version of the thesis must also be submitted at the same time.
 
 
Two copies of the thesis are require
d of the can
didate, one in electronic format and 
one in hard
-
bound format. The Pass List
 
w
ill not be issued until both the print version 
and electronic version of the thesis have been deposited with the University.

Plagiarism and the Certificate of Originality
 
 
I
t is the responsibilit

research degree 
candidate
 
aware of the legal and ethical principles of originality and copyright. 
 
 
To avoid charge
s of plagiarism or copyright infringement, the 
candidate
 
must 
acknowledge cl
ea
rly the use of a
ny
 
sec
ondary source at the point it is 
us
ed and 
obtain and acknowledge permission to reproduce published work. 
 
 
Reference also needs to be made to contributions 
from other sources if the research 
has involved working with others in any w
ay
. When the thesis is s
ubmitted for 
examination, the 
candidate
 
is required to complete a Certificate of Originality to cover 
these areas.
 
 
 
Plagiarism, intentional or not, may giv
e rise to a charge of Misconduct in Research.

Whil
e a candidate cannot influence the choice of examiners, it is good practice 
to
 
share freely with a 
c
andidate
 
the information concerning the recommendation of 
examiners and to inform 
them
 
on ratification of their appointment.
 
 
Once the thesis is submitted, 
the timing of the oral examination will depend on the 
availability of the ex
am
iners but should take 
place within three months. Exceptions 
and extension to this require approval by 
the Head of the Postgraduate Research
 
Service
 
(or nominee) for vivas taking 
place within four months or 
by 
the Academic 
Director of 
UEA Doctoral College
, 
on behalf of the

other requests
.
 
 
In exceptional circumstances, the Faculty Associate Dean (Postgraduate Research) 
or equivalent may agree to 
an oral examination

Candidates
 
s
hould be assessed sole
ly on the basis of the thesis and oral 
examination and are not permitted to make a formal presentation (e.g. by 
PowerPoint) prior to or as part of the oral 
examination, unless this is a reasonable 
adjustment that has been approved b

action.
 
 
After the oral examination and private discussion of the examiners, if the examiners 
agree on their recommendation, they may communicate this t
