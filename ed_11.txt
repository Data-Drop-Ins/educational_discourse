Policy
 
on Split

Site PhD 
Partnerships
 
 
1
 
Introduction
 
 
 
A split
-
site PhD is defined
 
as a PhD that leads to a University of East Anglia award and 
involves students being fully registered as University of East Anglia students whilst 
spending a significant period of their research away from the University, at another 
approved 
institution
, w
hich will normally be overseas. All split
-
site PhDs require a 
formal agreement between the University and the partner 
institution
(s). 
The split
-
site 
PhD is used to increase collaborative research and develop international partnerships. 
 
 
 
It may be appropri
ate to make indivi
dual student arrangements that
 
permit a student to 
undertake some of their research at an approved location away from the University 

 
for example, for students based in industry. These are not referred to as split
-
site 
PhDs as they do no
t involve institution
-
to
-
institution agreements.
 
 
 
Th
ere are other arrangements that
 
offer mobility to PGR students, inclu
ding students 
undertaking field
work or other specific visits away from the University. 
These 
types of 
arrangements may fall under the U

s 
Policy on 
Placements
 
or other policies, 
but
 
they should not be seen as split
-
site PhDs.

Principles of split
-
site provision
 
 
 
There should be a nominated lead academic at the University of East Anglia 
responsible for a particular split
-
site 
PhD 
a
rrangement. This individual would work 
closely with 
the Postgraduate Research Service, as well as with the 
International 
Office
 
and 
Academic 
Partnerships
 
(formerly the Partnerships Office) 
where 
appropriate.
 
 
 
 
Split
-
site PhD arrangements should be made wi
th institutions of good academic 

students.
 
 
 
Split
-
site PhD arrangements should be reviewed regul
arly
, at least every five years.
 
 
 
There should be a written agreement for all
 
split
-
site 
PhD 
arrangements
,
 
setting out 
the rights and responsibilities of the student, the University of East Anglia, and the 
partner institution(s).

How to approve a split
-
site PhD
 
 
 
Split
-
site PhD
 
partnership

borative approval 
mechanisms, and 
Academic 
Partnerships and 
the Postgraduate Research Service
 
should both be involved in their development and approval. 
The approval process is 
based on the assumption that 
each
 
relevant
 
Faculty Associate Dean of Postgradua
te 
Research
 
has been informed and is supportive of a split
-
site PhD proposal.
 
 
Contact the 
Postgraduate Research Service
 
3.1.1
 
Split
-
site PhD partnership proposals should be discussed initially with 
the Head of 
Postgraduate Research Service
, who will clarify who within the Postgraduate 
Research Service will support development of the prop
osal and liaise with 
Academic 
Partnerships. International split
-
site PhD partnerships should also be discussed 
with 
the International Office
, who 
may
 
be a
ble to give 
further 
specific guidance on a 
prospective partner and its educational system. 
 
 
Due diligence
, site visit and risk assessment
 
3.1.2
 
Due diligence should be completed on the partner in
stitution.
 
A checklist
 
is available 
from the Postgraduate Research Service. This 
should be completed and 
approved by 
the 
Doctoral College
 
Executive as part of the
 
approval of an arrangement. 
In some 
cases a site v
isit must be undertaken. This is 
to assure the Univ
ersity that students

The checklist 
covers quality assurance and risk assessment.
 
 
Approval
 
3.1.3
 
Split
-
site PhD 
partnerships need 
approval by the 
Doctoral College 
Executive, and 
would normally have been considered by the relevant Faculty Graduate School 
Executive in order to ensure that there is, or will be, a suitable 
training pathway
. 
They 
should also have approval from Senate, either in full or by delegation to the Pro
-
Vice
-
Chancell
or (Research and Innovation) depending on the level of risk involved.
 
 
4
 
Drafting an Agreement
 
 
 
A Memorandum 
of Agreement
 
should be signed at institutional level by the Vice
-
Chancell
or and the partner institution. 
However, no students will be admitted onto a
 
U
niversity of East Anglia PhD until an Individual Doctor
al Agreement is signed
.
 
 
 
After the initial arrangement, individual arrangements with the partner institution are 
then catered for by completion and signature of 
Individual Doctoral Agreements
, which 
are
 
incorporated, on signature, into the overarching 
Memorandum of Agreement, and 
which cover
 
arrangements for the supervision of each individual student.

Admissions, Registration
, Residence 
and Fees
 
 
 
Admissions
 
All admissions information and other 
arrangements, including for induction, must be 
available to students and members of the supervisory team at both UEA and the
 
partner institution
.
 
 
 
Registration
 
Students should 
register
 
annually w
ith their Faculty in UEA
. Students may also need to 
register 
temporarily with the partner insti
tution if this is a requirement
 
by that institution 
whilst studying away from UEA.
 
 
 
Residence
 

months (not necessarily over a continuous ti
me period). Although this is a minimum 
period, Faculties may feel it is appropriate to make the time spent at UEA longer. 
Exact timings for periods spent at UEA should be agreed at the outs
et, but should 
normally include at least six months in each of the 
first and final years. 
 
 
 
Fees
 
5.4.1
 
Usually, the following model of fees applies:
 

 
For the time spent at U
E
A: The annual full
-
time fee for PhD
 
students will apply 
(attendance in UEA must be for a minimum of 12 months in total). The fee will be 
charged pro rata in
 
any one year.
 

 
For the time spent at the partner institution: T
he annual fee to be paid to 
UEA will 
be at a reduced rate.
 
 
5.4.2
 
Any fee which may also be payable to the partner institution for the provision of 
supervisory support and the use of facilities durin
g the 
P
eriod(s) of 
S
tudy away from 
UEA would also need to be negotiated with the partner institution. This would be an 
arrangement between the Faculty, the student and the partner institution.

Research and transferable skills training
 
 
All doctoral students are expected to undergo a training needs analysis
. 
Arrangements 
for where and when this is to be carried out should be agreed at the outset of the 

al Doctoral Agreement.
 
Once the 

 
research and transferable skills training needs have been identified
,
 
it should 
be clearly set out in writing where and when any training will take place (i.e. at UE
A or 
at the partner institution
), and, if relevant, when it is to be assessed.
 
There may b
e a 
need to develop a separate training pathway for students on a given split
-
site PhD 
partnership arrangement.

Supervision arrangements
 
 
Supervision arrangements should be clearly specified. The supervisory team should 
be based
 
at UEA, with an additional named contact(s) at the partner institution. 
Composition of the supervisory team should comply with established criteria as set out 
in 

Code of Practice for Res
earch Degrees
.
 
In 
addition, consideration must be given to the level of inp
ut from the partner institution
, 
and this should be clearly defined at the outset.
 
 
 
Th
e timing of, and arrangements for, supervisory visit(s) must be agreed at the start of 

and 
the main supervisor
 
(by email, phone, Skype, etc) whilst the student is away. It is
 
also expected that the partner institution will provide any additional sources of support 
to the student if needed.
 
 
 
Supervisory requirements and the responsibilities of the supe
rvisory team should 
comply with 
the Code of Practice for Rese
arch Degrees
, taking into account any 
special or alternative arrangements that may need to be made in the light of any 
supervision being prov
ided at the partner institution. It is also important that students 
are a
ware of their responsibilities 
and that any special arrangements are put in place 
to enable them to carry out these responsibilities as requi
red at the partner institution
.

Monitorin
g student progress and formal reviews
 
 
It is the responsibi
lit
y of the Faculty, through the supervisory team, to ensure that 
student progress is monitored and supported and that formal review mechanisms are 
in place 
as in 
the
 
Code of Practice for Rese
arch Degrees
. Arrangements for progress 
monitoring and formal reviews should be agreed at the outset in writing, in consultati
on 
wi
th the partner institution
 
and with the student, and set out in the supervision 
agreement in the Memorandum of Agreement.
 
 
 
Effective supervision, and good organisation and planning on the part of both the 
student and members of the supervisory team, are fu
ndamental to the success of a 
split
-
site 
PhD arrangement
. It is therefore particularly important that informal 
monitoring and formal progress review meetings are carried out regularly, according to 
a pre
-
arranged schedule. Informal supervision meetings and
 
formal review meetings 
should be fully documented, involving appropriate communication between 
supervisors as necessary, so that it is clear to all concerned how, when and where any 
problems or issues arising are to be addressed, and any subsequent action
s taken.

Probationary Review
 
 
The 
probationary review
 
process should take place according to 

Regulations and 
Research Degree Policy Documents
. The expectation is that this 
process will take place at UEA.

Examination of the PhD
 
 
It is expected that the student will submit 
their
 
thesis to their Faculty in UEA and that 
the 
oral examination (viva)
 
will also take place in UEA. The student will be required to 
give notification of intention to submit in the normal way (i.e. 
at least
 
three
 
months prior 
to the date of submission). Exami
nation arrangements and the examination process 
should be carried out as set out in the 

Code of 
Practice 
for Research Degrees
.
 
 
 
The 
oral 
examination 
(viva) 
will take place in UEA and the Faculty should ensure that 
arrangements are communicated well in advance to all concerned including the 
partner institution.

Award
 
 
On successful completion, the re
search degree will be awarded by the University of 
East Anglia.

Appeals and Complaints
 
 
In accordance with normal practice, students and supervisors should be made aware 
of 
the 

. 

procedures should a
lso be invoked if a complaint or an 
A
cademic 
A
ppeal is made in 

Period 
of 
Study 
at the partner institution
, although certain 
non

academic complaints 
may be
 
considered under 
the 
partner institution

complaints
 
procedures
.

Renewal
 
 
Split
-
site PhD arrangements should be renewed periodically, and not more than every 
five years. Renewing a PhD requires the following process:
 
 
Informal discussions about the renewal
 
13.1.1
 
In the first instance, discuss the need for renewal with 
the Faculty 
Associate Dean for 
Postgraduate Research
 
and 
the Head of Postgraduate Research Service
.
 
If there is 
support for renewing the agreement, proceed to
 
13.1.2.
 
 
Due diligence
, site visit and r
isk assessment
 
13.1.2
 
Due diligence should be completed on the partner institution. 
A checklist
 
is available 
from the Postgraduate R
esearch Service. This should be completed and approved by 
the 
Doctoral College
 
Executive as part of the approval of an arrangement. In some 
cases a site v
isit must be undertaken. This is
 
to assure the University that students 
studying a PhD will continue t

Code of Practice for Research Degrees
 

The 
checklist covers quality assurance and risk assessment.
