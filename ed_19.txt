The Role of the Independent Chair
 
 
The University does not routinely appoint an Independent Chair for 
oral
 
examination
s.
  
An Independent Chair will be appointed in the following 
circumstances
:
 
 

 
Where there are two external examiners (e.g. in the case of the examination 
of a category A candidate)
;
 

 
Where an internal examiner has not examined previously under the UK 
research 
degree examination system
 
and
 
has not completed internal 
examiner training;
 

 
Where there is a second oral examination of the candidate (e.g. if  required 
following resubmission or an upheld 
Academic A
ppeal)
;
 

 
Where the 
oral
 
examination is being conducted by 
video
-
conference
 
/ 
S
kype 
or similar
;

Where 
an
 
additional External Examiner 
is 
appointed by the 
Academic Director 
of UEA Doctoral College
,
 
in accordance with 
the 
Regulation
s for the degree,
 
and 
requests a further oral examination of the 
candidate.
 
 
The 
University
 
requires the appointment of an Independent Chair in these cases to 
brief the examiner(s) before the examination and provide the examiner(s) with any 
necessary information about the examination procedure and any guidance that may 
be required as t
o the standard which is expected of research degree candidates at 
UEA. 
 
 
The Faculty Associate Dean (Postgraduate Research) may also decide to appoint an 
Independent Chair in other circumstances in which it is deemed appropriate, such as 
where there could 
be the perception of a minor conflict of interest, where the internal 
examiner holds an honorary appointment with UEA, at the request of the supervisor, 
candidate or 
School /Institute 
PGR Director, or where required as a reasonable 
adjustment for a candida
te to ensure that these adjustments are appropriately 
followed.

from the

Dean of Postgraduate 
Research

The Independent Chair will liaise
 
subsequently 
with the Primary Supervisor 
and the External Examiners to clarify any issues arising from the formal 
report, requirements for corrections or recommendations for revision of the 
thesis
.
 
 
 

 
Where minor corrections are recommended 
it is the responsibility of the 
designated External Examiner, not the
 
Independent Chair
, to 
review the thesis 
and confirm to 
the Postgraduate Research Service
 
that the minor corrections 
have been completed.
 
 
 
Appointment
 
 
The 
I
n
dependent 
C
hair
 

who has extensive experience of examining research degrees. Knowledge of the 
subject area of the thesis is not required and the 
I
n
dependent 
C
hair
 
may, if 
necessary, be a member of academic staff
 
from a School other than that in which the 
student is registered.
 
 
To avoid possible conflict of interest, the 
I
n
dependent 
C
hair
 
should not have been 

the supervisory team.
 
 
It should be emphasised to examiners that the appointment of an 
I
n
dependent 
C
hair
 
is in no sense intended as a comment on their academic ability but is rather to 
ensure the examination is conducted according to the appropriate
 
UEA procedures 
and to protect
 
the interests of the examiners and the candidate.
