RESEARCH DEGREE POLICY DOCUMENTS
 
 
 



 


 
 
1.
 
Who do these guidelines apply to?
 
F
rom 
1 October 2015 the status of research 
degree 
candidates on the following 
programmes 
is now
 

 
This also 
applies to candidates 
starting
 
the EdD 
on or after 1 
October 2019.
 
The
 
probationary 
status will continue until the candidate
 
has
 
undertaken
 
and pass
ed
 
a formal 
assessment during their first year 
(for 
full
-
time 
candidates) or first two years (
for part
-
time 
candidates including
 
MD candidates registering after 1 January 2018 
and 
EdD 
candidates
 
starting on or after 1 October 2019
), 
which will occur at 
the Annual
 
Progress 
and Probationary 
Review meeting. 
Candidates
 
intending to graduate with a 
PhD 
must
 
be registered as probationary PhD candidates rather than as MPhil 
candidates
; 
candidates
 
commencing from October 2019 onwards and 
inte
nding to 
graduate with a
n EdD
 
must
 
be registered as probationary 
EdD
 
candidates rather than 
as 
MEd
 
candidates
.
 
Schools will no longer be able to approve the transfer of MPhil 
candidates to the PhD programme 
or, for 
candidates
 
commencing from October 2019 
o
nwards, from the MEd programme to the EdD programme 

 
this will only be done on 
an exceptional basis by a concession approved by the Academic Director of 
UEA 
Doctoral College
.

Composition and timing of the 
P
robationary 
Review M
eeting
 
The meeting will 
consist of the
 
research degree candidate
, the
 
supervisory team
 
and 

 
internal 
assessor
(s) will be
 
independent 
of
 
the supervisory team
. The chair
 
of the panel
 
and 
any
 
other internal assessor 
will 
be 
appointed by the Head of School
/Chair of NBI 
Graduate School Executive
 
(or 
their nominee, normally the School
/Institute
 
Director of 
Postgraduate Research
) 
in conjunction with the supervisory team
. The 

chair
 
should 
be
 
research active, have 
been the primary supervisor (to 
successful 
completion) of at least one research 
degree candidate
 
and 
should 
not be
 
involved with 
the 
candidate

project
 
and supervision.
 
 
The supervisory team should be reminded 
that 
when appointing the chair 
it may be helpful to give consideration to the diversity of 
the team.  
 
The panel should be proposed 
at 
the first interim 
progress 
meeting of the 
candidate
 
and the 
supervisory 
team and
 
communicated 
to the School 
or Institute 
Director
 
of 
Postgraduate Research
.
 
The confirmed assessors will be reported to 
the relevant 
Postgr
aduate Research Service team
 
for approval.

Assessment criteria for the 
Probationary R
eview
 
Meeting
 
Candidates will be asked
 
to demonstrate that they satisfy the following criteria at 
the 
Probationary R
eview
 
Meeting
. These reflect the final assessment criteria, but at a 

 
 

 

 
appropriate 
acknowledgement of the work of others where there is an element of 
collaboration?
 

 
Has the candidate shown appropriate industry?
 

 
Is the candidate competent to fulfil the research and to keep to the proposed 
schedule of work?
 

 
Does the candidate 
show the level of knowledge and understanding of the field 
in which they are working that would normally be expected after 6
-
9 
months of 
research
 
(
pro rata for part
-
time candidates
)
? 
 

 
Is the candidate able to show how their work relates to this wider field
 
and that 
they have developed a command of presentational and scholarly conventions 
and methodology?
 

 
Is there evidence that the work has a reasonable prospect of generating a 
significant contribution to the development of understanding, for example, 
throug
h the discovery of new knowledge, the connection of previously unrelated 
facts, and the development of a new theory or the revision of older views?
 

 
[PhD/MD
/EdD
 
only] Is the topic viable as doctoral research in its originality
, 
intellectual level
 
and scope (for execution within the planned timeframe)
?

;
 

 
P
resent a timeline for the remainder of the

Training Record
 
All research degree 
candidates
 
registered on or after 1 October 2017, and those 
candidates
 

requirements by compliance with a Training Pathway, should submit an up to date 
Personal and Professional Development Plan (PDP)
. 
Candidates

week
s
 
before the 
meeting.  This research report should include:
 
 

 
a declaration of originality;
 

 
a working bibliography;
 

 
a statement of intent
:
 
This is a crucial document since it is the document in 
which the ambitions of the research and its overall met
hodology can be most 
clearly seen. The statement of intent is therefore expected to be up to 3,000 
words and to cover the research context (i.e. the established scholarship to 
which the research is meant to provide an intervention), the major research 
ques
tions (what the research will aim to find out) and the methodological and 
conceptual frameworks applied;
 

 
an outline of the structure of the thesis with titles and a description of the likely 
argument of each chapter;
 

 
a schedule of work;

Resolving Disagreement
 
Where the panel cannot agree on the recommendation

it shall refer the matter to the Head of School. The Head 
of School or their nominee (who shall normally be the School/Institute Director of

I

shall 
write 
formally 
to the candidate
, 
including
 
an action plan setting out measurable goals to be 
achieved and the timescale 
for achieving these
. 
The candidate will be required to

set of 
goals can be

by the panel
, 
the Head of School
 
shall

Internship
s
 
Some 
research degree 
candidates
 
have an internship (e.g. NRP DTP) or an ind
ustrial 
placement
 
(e.g. 
iCASE) as part of their study.  
Candidates
 
will not normally be able to 
undertake such an activity until 
they have been confirmed in their PhD and have 
successfully completed their probationary period.
