 Exploring 
wellbeing and mental health and associated 
support services for postgraduate researchers
  Executive summary
 This report presents the findings of a research project undertaken by Vitae and partners for 
the former Higher Education Funding Council for England
 (HEFCE) to improve its 
understanding of the wellbeing and mental health of postgraduate researchers (PGRs) and 
associated institutional support. 
 There has been increased interest in the wellbeing and mental health of undergraduate 
students in higher educ
ation
 and significant increases in demand for mental health services. 
There is less understanding
, however, on 
the incidence of mental health issues
 amongst 
PGRs and how these needs are met.
 The policies and provision relating to the wellbeing and mental h
ealth of PGRs were 
explored at ten higher education institutions (HEIs)
 through interviews with key staff and 
PGR focus groups
. This included 
identifying 
the risk factors among PGRs in terms of their 
wellbeing and 
mental health
, and the challenges institut
ions face and the effectiveness of 
provision. PGR experiences of wellbeing and mental health 
issues
 and their experiences 
of institutional support and services were explored in focus groups. A pilot survey was run at 
six HEIs to establish a method to measu
re the extent of mental health proble
ms experienced 
by PGRs.
  Institutional policies 
on PGR wellbeing and mental health
 Case study HEIs
 all had clearly articulated policies for student mental health support 
services 
that included 
PGRs
, although two HEIs 
were in the process of developing specific 
policies for PGRs
. They all 
recognised that the research degree experience is significantly 
different from that of taught courses and this could create specific challenges in ensuring 
their wellbeing and mental he
alth. 
The 
PGRs
 within the focus groups
 consistently reported 
that they did not associate themselves with the general student body and saw institutional 
messages about student services as primarily targeted at the undergraduate population. 
 Factors affectin
g PGR wellbeing
 Focus group 
PGRs 
consistently described 
the doctoral degree 
as 
a stressful experience at 
some stage. Some PGRs 
reported 
a lack of clarity 
in the expectations for their research and 
little positive feedback on their progress. 
Expectation
s of high achievement
 and high 
workloads
 associated with doctoral degrees may create an environment which can tr
igger 
imposter syndrome
 in PGRs who experience self
-doubt and also discourage PGRs from 
seeking help if their stress becomes unhealthy
. They were aw
are that academics were also 
experiencing high level of stress and were likely to take the culture 
with
in their department
 or 
group
 as more indicative of the institutional attitude to the wellbeing of staff and students 
than the central 
institutional 
messa
ges they received.  
 There was consensus across staff and PGRs that difficult
ies
 in the supervisory relationship 
were
 a common 
cause of
 wellbeing issues. 
A few PGRs described poor supervisory 
relationships that impacted on their wellbeing and mental health
, but some PGRs 
in p
ositive 
supervisory relationships 
were
 also 
reluctant to talk 
to their supervisors 
about their 
wellbeing
. They expressed concern about how this may reflect on 
their ability to achieve 
their doctorate and 
the possible impact on 
their car
eer prospects. 
 Financial concerns were also highlighted as potential causes of stress, particularly for 
self
-funded PGRs and 
those approaching 
the end of their funding. Other risks factors raised 
to some extent by PGRs and staff 
included sexual harassment
 and harassment generally, and 
PGR 
concern
s about their next career step.

 PGRs p
otentially 
at risk of developing poor mental health
 Among doctoral school and faculty staff, discussions about 
PGR 
vulnerability were often 
dominated by 
the experienc
es of international PGRs, including adjust
ing
 to a new culture, 
finance, visas
 and potentially less access to family and friend support.
 Isolated PGRs were also identified a
s potentially at risk
, including those
 on fieldwork and 
remote camp
uses
, part
-time or mat
ure PGRs. 
 A few staff mentioned that 
PGRs who were 
working in research groups could 
also 
feel a sense of isolation if they did
 not feel integrated 
into their research community.
 There was some evidence from the pilot survey of the 
benefits of cohort train
ing. These PGRs were more likely to have regular 
contact with their 
supervisor
s and engaged in their research community. 
 Part
-time PGRs
, researchers with disabilities
 and those with family responsibilities were 
likely to experience multiple risk factors, 
such as financial issues and work
-life balance, as 
well as more universal issues such as imposter syndrome. 
A few PGRs reported concerns 
about their 
entitlement to maternity and paternity leave
; further complicated for those on 
Tier 
4 visas
.  Extent of men
tal health issues
 It was not possible to get a view of the extent of mental health issues within the PGR 
population through the case studies. Student support services at all 
HEIs recorded 
the use 
of their services by students
, including 
by 
PGRs, but this i
nformation was not collated across 
the HEI to provide an overview of the proportion of PGRs using the range of wellbeing and 
mental health services. 
 Several HEIs mentioned 
PGR 
annual progress reviews as an opportunity to highlight and 
record any wellbeing
 issues. However, PGRs 
reported being 
unwilling to talk about wellbeing 
issues if they fel
t it w
ould
 reflect badly on how their progress is viewed.
 Student support services
 All HEIs provided comprehensive student support services
 and effective procedures f
or 
mental health issues
. Demand from PGRs was not viewed as a significant workload
 on 
counselling services, although
 there 
was
 consensus across HEIs that
 they 
were seeing an 
overall rise in PGRs 
with 
mental health
 issues
.  HEIs used a variety of communicat
ion 
methods to promote their services to students
 generally and 
common
ly had
 a dedicated 
online 
PGR wellbeing web 
section
. However, 
not all PGRs reported good awareness of 
sources of support 
and felt that 
HEIs need
ed to provide 
more 
communications and 
interventions targeted directly at PGRs.
 Graduate schools and researcher development programmes
 Graduate school
s structures and functions at the HEIs differed, but generally they all had 
overall responsibility for the PGR experience, including the provisio
n of researcher 
development programmes. Some 
Graduate schools also provided social spaces
, café 
facilities, and organised events to foster the PGR community
 and to some extent provided 
pastoral guidance, formally or informally
. Graduate school staff report
ed regularly being 
approached by PGRs with wellbeing and other issues. Increasingly, they are delivering 
targeted wellbeing courses and activities for PGRs, and integrating wellbeing elements into 
their wider researcher development provision. 
 Supervision 
and other academic support
 for PGR wellbeing and mental health
     
 All HEIs 
described 
the pivotal role that
 supervisors
 play in supporting the wellbeing and 
mental health of PGRs
 and that they are 
ideally placed to identify when their PGRs are 
becoming st
ressed before they are visibly distressed
. HEIs acknowledged 
the lack of 
support for supervisors 
in this important pastoral role and s
everal 
were looking
 at providing 
more support and training 
in wellbeing and mental health
 for supervisors
 and postgraduate
 3 Vitae, ©

 tutors
. Supervisors also need to feel that their own wellbeing 
and mental health 
is a priority 
for the institution 
and they are encouraged to 
be role models 
for their PGRs in
 adopting
 healthy ways of working. More research is needed into supervisors™ perc
eptions of their role 
in supporting the wellbeing and mental health of PGRs
, how capable they feel in that role
 and identify examples of good practice. 
  Conclusions and recommendations
 Provid
ing
 a safe working environment for PGRs that supports their well
being and mental 
health
 requires 
systemic culture change
 and top-down commitment to promoting mental 
health. The academic culture of high
-achievement
 and high workloads
 creates an 
environment where wellbeing is more likely to be at risk and 
PGRs 
may feel l
ess able to
 talk 
about their wellbeing
 and mental health
. The Universities UK Framework for Mental Health, 
contextualised to reflect the PGR environment,
 would 
provide HEIs with the means to 
develop effective strateg
ies
 to promot
e better wellbeing, prevent
 mental health issues and 
provid
e effective interventions for PGRs.
 HEIs need to invest more resources in student support services and associated activities to 
meet 
expected PGR demand, and 
provide 
increased 
mental 
health literacy and prevention 
activities targeted specifically at PGRs and supervisors.  More 
should be done to analyse 
existing data on PGR use of wellbeing and mental health services
 to measure the level
 of engagement
. The pilot survey 
should be extended to obtain 
robust 
data on the extent of 
PGR mental health problems in the UK.
 There is much to be gained from sharing practice 
and experiences across
 the sector, for example through the 
Catalyst 
funding ta
rgeted at 
the mental health and wellbeing of PGRs
.  Recommendations for 
UKRI
 and other stakeholders
 With the formation of UKRI 
in 
April 2018, HEFCE™s responsibiliti
es for PGRs w
ere 
incorporated 
into Research England, who share 
responsibility for PGRs in English HEIs with the Office of 
Students (OfS). 
UKRI
 should collaborate with
 the OfS, 
other funding bodies, U
niversities 
UK 
and other stakeholders to take forward these recommendations to ensure a healthy and 
supportive research 
environment for postgraduate researchers
 Recommendation 1: 
UKRI
 should work with UUK, other stakeholders and the HE sector to 
contextualise the
 Universities UK
 Framework for Mental Health for the PGR environment. 
 Recommendation 3: 
UKRI
 should commission a
 project that explores how supervisors, and 
postgraduate tutors, perceive their role in supporting the wellbeing and mental health of PGRs 
and identifies the principles of good management practice that are applicable to the supervisory 
relationship.
 Recomm
endation 8: 
UKRI
 should extend the pilot survey to achieve a representative response 
sample to assess the extent of mental health issues in the UK PGR population. 
 Recommendation 10: 
UKRI and the OfS 
should facilitate practice
-sharing mechanisms around 
the Catalyst Fund projects and the sector generally, particularly encouraging case studies of 
where improved mental health resulted in improved PGR outcomes.    
 4 Vitae, © 
2018 The Careers Research and Advisory Centre (CRAC) Limited
    Recommendations for institutions 
 Recommendation 2: HEIs should develop institutional strategies to support the wellbeing and 
mental health of PGRs based on the UUK Mental Health framework. 
 Recommendation 4: HEI
s should develop robust procedures for monitoring supervisory 
relationships and providing timely, transparent and fair mechanisms for dealing with 
supervisory issues. 
 Recommendation 5: Supervisors, and postgraduate tutors, should be t
rained, supported and 
recognised for their role in the identification and early intervention 
in 
wellbeing 
and mental 
health 
issues 
of their PGRs.
 Recommendation 6: As part of their strategic plan for PGR wellbeing, HEIs should develop 
communication strateg
ies to promote points of entry into student support services specifically to 
PGRs. 
 Recommendation 7: As part of their strategic plan for PGR wellbeing, HEIs should monitor the 
extent of mental health issues for PGRs and demand for associated services.
 Rec
ommendation 9: HEIs need to consider how they resource their student support services 
and other relevant departments to support the wellbeing 
and mental health 
of PGRs, 
particularly activities aimed at prevention and early intervention.

 Exploring wellbe
ing and mental health and associated support 
services for postgraduate researchers
 1 Introduction 
 Vitae in partnership with t
he Institute for Employment 
Studies (IES) and Professor Kati
a Levecque from the University of Ghent were commissioned 
in 2017 
by the
 former 
Higher 
Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) to improve their understanding of 
the wellbeing and mental health of postgraduate researchers (PGR) and the associated support 
provided by 
higher education institutions
 (HEIs)
.  1.1
 Background
 HEFCE
™s stated 
aim
 with
in the HE research environment was
 ‚to 
develop and sustain a 
dynamic and internationally competitive research sector that makes a major contribution to 
economic prosperity, national wellbeing and the expansion and dissemination of knowled
ge™. The training and developing 
of postgraduate 
researchers form
s a critical link in the supply 
chain for the UK research base and knowledge
-intensive economy and the 
provision of 
postgraduate research degrees is a key and thriving part of higher educatio
n in the UK. 
There has been strong growth and 
diversity of provision over the last 20 years and the UK 
has an enviable international reputation. Many institutions have ambitious growth targets 
and, with the current uncertainty around Brexit, it is importan
t that the UK™s international 
reputation for providing a world
-class research qualification is maintained. 
 HEFCE 
recognise
d the importance of 
providing a healthy and supportive research environment for 
nurturing new generations of researchers
.  Student me
ntal health
 Recently t
here has been increased interest in 
the wellbeing and mental health 
of students 
in 
higher education, particularly of undergraduates. 
The introduction of fees, a more student
-centred approach, 
the widening participation
 agenda
, legislative obligations and targeted 
funding has led to an increase in the provision of 
specialist 
HEI 
mental health services
 and the introduction of wellbeing initiatives. 
This 
increase in provision 
has 
helped to respond 
to a 50% increase in the demand 
from students 
for mental health and wellbeing services 
between 2010/11 and 2014/15
1. That increase may have 
been driven 
in part by less stigma 
around disclosure, 
but also by 
widening participation, 
reductions
 in NHS support and 
increased ‚stressors™, such as student loans. During this period, the number of 
undergraduate students recorded by HESA declar
ing
 a mental health condition trebled from 
0.4% to 1.3%
2, but there is presumed
 still 
to be a high level of non
-disclosure. Other survey 
evidence suggests that around 15% of undergraduates report mental health issues
3. The 2015 IES research project
4 on institutional support for students with mental health 
conditions identified student support services as the hub for p
rovision to provide ease of 
student access
, including PGRs,
 and improve staff communication. Formal institutional 
provision is likely to include welfare support, mental health advisors, academic 
support and 
tutoring, counselling services, disability servic
es, peer support and mentoring. This is 
reinforced by HEIs working with external agencies and networks, such as the NHS and GPs 
(albeit restricted by lack of 
NHS 
funding), UMHAN
5, AOSSHE
6, specialist 
charities; and a 
                                                 1 www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/23/university

 PGR mental health
 There is les
s data on the incidence of mental health issues amongst the postgraduate 
research
er (PGR) population and how these needs are met. 
Amongst postgraduate 
research
ers
, only 0.9% declared a mental health condition to their HEI in 2013
-143. This is in 
marked 
contrast to the results of the most recent
 Postgraduate Research Experience Survey 
(PRES, 
2017
)7 where 
3.3% of respondents reported that they had 
a mental health condition
.  A recent literature review commissioned by the Royal Society 
and Wellcome Trust 
into the understanding of mental health of researchers
8 found limited evidence of the prevalence of 
specific mental health conditions among researchers and only a small number of studies that 
focused on PGRs. The majority of literature relates to work
-relate
d stress, 
which can lead to 
depression and anxiety
. This is reported to be higher amongst academic staff than across 
the general population and is at a similar level to that for healthcare professionals. 
Generally, 
mental health difficulties seem to be und
er-reported within 
higher education
 as one in four 
adults will experience mental illness at 
some point in their lifetime and one in six experience 
symptoms at any one time
9.  This under
-reporting is supported by
 a recent study on mental health problems of 
PGRs in 
Flanders
10
, which used the 
General Health Questionnaire
11
 (GHQ
-12) to identify that 32% of 
the PGR population ‚are at risk of having or developing a common psychiatric disorder, 
especially depression™. A similar study in Leiden University in The Neth
erlands using the 
GHQ
-12 identified that two in five PGRs are at risk of having or developing a psychiatric 
disorder
12
. This is in comparison with 19% of 25
-34 year old UK residents showing evidence 
indicating depression or anxiety
13
. Doctoral degrees are th
ought to be stressful
14
, and arguably therefore PGRs are potentially 
at higher risk of developing a mental health condition than undergraduates. Stress is not 
always negative and building resilience is an important quality for successful researchers. 
Howeve
r, there is a common link between high job demands and emotional exhaustion or 
depressive feelings
7.  The 2017 PRES included new questions about wellbeing and retention. Although more than 
60% of PGRs were satisfied with their work
-life balance, and 85% fe
lt their degree 
programme was worthwhile, 26% of respondents had considered leaving or suspending their 
degree programme. Initial analysis indicates that this 
is linked to different demographic and 
study characteristics
.    We can hypothesise that s
ome com
munities within the PGR population are likely to be more 
susceptible to developing a mental health condition, such as women
 (who are more 
susceptible 
than men 
in the general population)
, part
-time researchers, distance learners, 
self
-funded PGRs and those 
working in isolation
10
. PGRs with physical health problems or 
learning difficulties are also more likely to experience a higher percentage of mental health

. The 2017 PRES results show that PGR
s who consider the
y have
 a disability, and 
particularly 
a mental health 
impairment
, are more likely to have considered leaving or 
suspending their doctoral studies 
at 48% and 60%, respectively. The Flanders study 
identified work
-family balance, job demands, job control, supervisor leadership style, 
and team 
decision
-making culture a
ll to be
 linked to mental health problems in PGRs. 
 Mental health at work
 Although PGRs generally are not employees, there are synergies with supporting the mental 
health of PGRs with that of employees. 
Effective management of ment
al health in the 
research environment
, or in 
the workplace more generally has tangible implications for 
productivity, performance and staff turnover. As well as being a major driver of sickness 
absence
, mental health problems can result in presenteeism, wh
ere individuals attend work 
and are less productive. For the UK HE sector, the costs of 
staff 
presenteeism alone (when 
defined as unwell, disengaged or distracted) has been estimated at more than £500
M per 
year
16
. This can be reduced through e
ffective manag
ement aimed at helping people thrive 
by 
providing a healthy, motivating and high performance work environment: there is good 
evidence that a happy 
and engaged workforce is also a productive one
17
. Under the Equality Act, mental health
 is included within dis
ability as 
a ‚protected 
characteristic™ and 
employers 
have 
a legal obligation not to discriminate against employees 
with, or with a history of, recognised mental health conditions. 
The recent report for 
Government, ‚Thriving at Work™
18
, observes that too ma
ny people experience discrimination 
on the grounds of mental health in the workplace and recommends that protection for 
employees with mental health conditions should be further enhanced to ensure employers 
provide reasonable adjustments. 
It proposes six c
ore standards for all employers to facilitate 
a supportive environment
 for mental health:
  Produce, implement and communicate a mental health at work plan
  Develop mental health awareness among employees
  Encourage open conversations about mental health and t
he support available when 
employees are struggling
  Provide employees with good working conditions
  Promote effective people management
  Routinely monitor emplo
yee mental health and wellbeing
 While working practices that support good mental health are 
important, people can become 
unwell regardless of their work environment: mental health problems affect an estimated one 
in four people each year across the UK population
19
. Therefore there will be instances where 
institutions
 under their ‚duty of care™ 
need to be reactive and where possible intervene early 
to ensure the right kind of specialist support is provided. Line managers and
, for PGRs
, supervisors arguably represent the ‚frontline™ of wellbeing management and act as a 
gatekeeper to referrals or othe

with respect to healthy ways of working, and create an environment that is open to dialogue 
around mental health.

 Universities UK ha
s had mental health as 
a policy priority since 2016. 
In 2017 it
 published its 
Framework for Mental Health
 (Figure 1)
 ‚to encourage university leaders to adopt a whole 
institution approach to improving mental health
™ for both staff and students
20
. More 
information on the Framework is given in Appendix 1. 
UUK is working 
with 
University of the 
West of England, Cardiff University, University of York and Student Minds to pilot and 
implement the strategic framework
 for students
, funded through the Catalyst programme
. Figure 1: UUK Framework for Mental Health: whole university approach
 Given the general increased interest in mental health and wellbeing of students and staff
, and the challenges for HEIs in identifying individuals at risk and providing appropriate 
support services, this study into the experiences of PGRs is timely and 
has been 
welcomed 
by the HE sector.

 Research
 aims
 and objectives
 The princip
al aim of this 
project is 
to provide a better understanding of the mental health and 
wellbeing of current postgraduate research students in UK higher education. 
This included 
providing an insight into the support currently available to PGRs and 
piloting a survey 
method w
hich might be used 
to assess 
the extent of mental health problems experienced by 
PGRs. 
 Key 
research

 Approach and methodology
 The research was conducted through 
institutional visits to explore existing p
ractice through 
interviews 
with relevant staff 
and focus groups
 with researchers
 between 
September and 
November 2017. A 
pilot survey of doctoral researchers 
was conducted between October and 
December 2017
 at a sample of institutions
. Generally, reference to HEIs and PGRs within 
the report relates to the case study ins
titutions and the PGRs who attended the focus 
groups
.  All UK institutions were invited by 
(then) 
HEFCE, or the relevant Funding Body, to 
participat
e as 
a case study institution. There was strong interest from the sector with 8
7 institutions 
expressing int
erest in participating
 in the project
. A sample of ten institutions w
as selected to 
reflect the
 diversity
 of institutions and 
doctoral training environments within the UK. 
The final 
sample 
consisted of seven Russell Group institutions
 and three other institutions
, including 
a Scot
tish institution 
and a Welsh institution
; a specialist institution was 
also 
included. 
In 
agreement with HEFCE, the names of the case study institutions remain confidential.  
 Our
 qualitative research 
included
 face to face 
interviews with a range of academics and 
professional staff involved in the mental health 
and wellbeing 
of PGRs. Th
ey comprised
 pro
-vice
-chancellors, 
heads of departments, 
directors of student support, directors/mangers of 
disability services,
 directors of graduate schools, student union officers
, college officers, 
welfare 
and counselling 
offices, 
departmental administrators, postgraduate tutors and 
supervisors. 
A list of the job titles and departments of interviewees is given in Appendix 2. 
 Each of the institutions identified 
a range of 
relevant individuals 
to interview and also 
organised a group of postgraduate researchers for focus group discussions. The 
ten focus 
groups 
each comprised between 
five 
and eight
 PGRs 
from a range of disciplines,
 year of 
study
, modes of study
 and nationality
. They generally were self
-selected and reported their 
individual experiences, although several focus groups included representatives of PGR 
groups or networks who provided a broader account of PGR experiences.
 The focus groups
 included PGRs 
who have, or had, 
experienced
 a mental health issue
, such as stress, anxiety 
or depression,
 during their doctoral degree programme and those who had not. All 
individuals were guaranteed anonymity.
 The interviews explored the
 policies and provision relating to the wellbeing and mental 
health of PGRs
. Interviewees were encouraged to participate in an open discussion of the 
risk factors among PGRs, the
 challenges institutions face in supporting the mental health of 
PGRs
 and the 
effectiveness of provision. The PGR focus groups explored their experiences 
of wellbeing and mental health problems, their perceptions of the factors that could p
ut PGRs at risk and their experiences of institutional support and services.
  All case study i
nstitutions were 
also 
invited to participate in the pilot survey. Due to various 
circumstances in the timing of the survey and othe
r activities at the institutions
, six institutions participated in the 
pilot survey
, which ran between October and December.
 PGRs 
were invited to participate in the pilot survey and were sent weekly reminders, either by the 
HEI or the project team. 
1,857 complete responses were obtained, representing 14% of the 
overall 
participating HEIs™ PGR population
: response rates at indivi
dual institutions were all
 similarly
 low.
 Comparison of the demographic profile of respondents (gender, age, 
nationality) and the characteristics of their doctoral studies (mode of study, year of study, 
discipline) revealed a respondent sample that was 
neither 
representative of the HEIs PG
R population
, or of the wider UK population
 (Appendix 
3).  It was likely 
that the low response rate 
also represented 
a skewed 
response 
sample. 
17% of 
respondents report
ed they had 
a pre
-existing mental health condition 
before starting their 
doctorate
 which is c
onsiderably higher than the level of disclosure by
 PGRs reported in the 
HESA data (0.9%) and PRES
 2017 (3.3%). Additionally, analysis of free text responses 
10 Vitae, © 
2018 The Careers Research and Advisory Centre (CRAC) Limited
 revealed a high proportion of comments relating to person
al mental health 
problems of a 
predominately negative tenor
. This ‚over
-representation™ of PGRs with mental health 
conditions 
was also seen to some extent in PGR participation in the focus groups.
  Due to the combination of 
low response rate
, unrepresentat
ive p
rofile of respondents
 both within the HEIs and of the HE sector more generally, and the skewed response sample
, it 
was not possible to use 
the survey results
 to assess the prevalence of mental health 
conditions in PGRs. 
As a pilot
, however,
 the survey
 does provide a
n insight into
 the views 
and experiences that can be explored through a survey instrument. The
 survey results 
did 
provid
e insight
s into 
respondents who 
wer
e more likely to have experienced mental health 
problems and engaged 
with HEI support 
services. 
It also 
gave an indication of the 
differences between PGRs
 of different demographics 
and mode of study, which are reported 
through the text
, where relevant
. More information on the 
pilot survey 
methodology 
and profile of respondents 
is given in A

 2 Institutional 
policies and 
provision
 This chapter explores institutional policies and provision relating to the wellb
eing and mental 
health of PGRs and how these fit within the general context of mental health support across 
the individual 
institution
s. With ten, albeit diverse, case study 
institutions
 the description of 
provision 
can only be seen as indicative of the situation across the UK
. The qualitative 
nature of the 
visits
 means that the findings 
should n
ot be taken as representative o
f the UK 
HE sector. 
Similarly, PGRs attending the focus groups to a large extent were self
-selecting 
and the themes emerging from these discussions may not be representative of the general 
PGR population
. It is worth noting, however, that although some of 
the experiences reported 
by PGRs in the focus groups and survey responses may have be
en isolated incidences, 
they were the perceived experience
s of these individuals
 and worthy of notice
. Furthermore, 
there are some findings that 
were consistent 
across 
the case study institutions and 
reflected 
in staff interviews and PGR focus groups, which 
could be seen as indicative of the general 
environment
 within postgraduate research degrees.
    It was clear from the level 
of interest from institutions in participatin
g in the project
, and the 
engagement of a
ll ten case study institutions
, especially 
organising visits 
at the beginning of 
the academic year,
 that UK HEIs we
re 
aware of the importance of and the need to ensure 
the mental health of PGRs. 
All the case study i
nstitutions recognise
d that they have a duty of 
care for all students, not just legally through the Equality Act, but morally in providing a 
positive experience for their students. 
They also recognise
d that the experien
ce of PGRs in 
research degrees was
 significantly different from that of students on taught courses and this 
could
 create specific challenges in ensuring their wellbeing and mental 
health. 
A couple of 
institutions 
also
 mentioned the business case for attracting PGRs and ensuring that they 
successfully complete their research degrees on time
, and how improving their mental health 
could contribute to that 
end. Institutions 
were looking at 
PGR 
mental health 
provision 
within the context of significant 
increases in the demand for mental health su
pport
, particularly
 from
 undergraduate students.  
All institutions ha
d clearly articulated policies for student 
mental health 
support services and 
conside
red
 their 
mental health provision for PGRs
 within the wider student body. 
Indeed, several stressed the
 importance 
of the message 
of mental health services 
being 
available for 
all
 and promoting the inclusiveness of services
.  Practice differ
ed in 
institutions 
between those 
that 
provide
d a single point of access and 
those who provide
d students with direct access to relevant services. Staff and PGRs 
highlighted the pros and cons of both approaches. 
The single point of contact, i
.e. effectively
 a ‚triage™ system
, provide
d a clear message to students of where to go and how to access 
servi
ces. This can be beneficial for PGRs who present with one issue, for example a 
concern about their finances, whereas there 
may be
 an underlying issue about their 
wellbeing or mental health. All 
HEIs
 reported 
examples of 
PGRs presenting with a practical 
iss
ue such as finance, career questions
 or research deadlines, which was masking a deeper 
wellbeing 
or mental health 
issue. An initial consultation could direct the PGR to more 
appropriate 
support. Conversely, some PGRs and 
student u
nion officers reported tha
t PGRs 
didn™t want to be seen going into 
a service that is seen to be about ‚student problems™ and
 found it frustrating to have to explain their concern 
more than once
. They were also 
concerned that the fact that they had accessed student support services 
would get back to 
their supervisor
. There was a general theme coming through the focus groups 
and the interviews 
that PGRs 
did not associate themselves with the general student body. 
This was reinforced by 
student union officers who talked about the diffic
ulties of engaging with PGRs
, who 
saw institutional 
messages about student services as primarily targeted at the undergraduate population. 
 ‚At present I
 believe that the issue of well
being amongst postgraduate researchers is being 
overlooked to a large degree. There is not the same degree of support that is currently being 
12 Vitae, © 
2018 The Careers Research and Advisory Centre (CRAC) Limited
 provided to undergraduates, despite the fact that PGR
s often suffer from feelings of 
isolation, loneliness and are
 under exceptional amounts of pressure workload wise.™
 2.1
 Institutional policies
 At the time of the research, n
one of the institutions ha
d a formally articulated policy for 
postgraduate researchers, although two institutions were in the process of developing 
specific PGR mental health policies. However, 
all
 institutions 
recognised that PGRs form a 
discrete cohort and 
provid
ed specific activities 
targeted 
to support the wellbeing of PGRs 
under the auspices of the Graduate School, or through their researcher dev
elopment 
programmes.  
 Despite the recognised differences in 
the experiences of PGRs 
undertaking a doctoral 
degree, o
nly one institution had set
 up a separate ‚point of entry™ into student services 
specifically targeted for PGRs. 
This was based in the Grad
uate School and consisted of an 
initial triage system providing sign
-postings to relevant services and regular ‚surgeries™
 just 
for PGRs
, staffed by experienced staff from other services, e.g. finance office and 
counselling services.  
 ‚University mental h
ealth and wellbeing services are often focused mainly (and 
understandably) on undergraduate and master level students. I believe PhD students should 
have access to dedicated services, akin to what would be accessible pr
ivately but that PhD 
students can
not afford. 
Further, I also believe effective integration of wellbeing and mental 
health within the PhD programmes themselves, in ways that are not bureaucratic and 
burdensome, is the best way to improve wellbeing (as well as completion rates and times!) 
among
 PhD students. For example, enabling students to implement work strategies 
recommended by
 mental health professionals into their PhD work schedule and deadlines.™ 
 2.2
 Student support services 
 All HEIs
 described
 comprehensive 
student support services
, althoug
h names and s
tructures 
differ
ed. The
se commonly include
d disability services, mental health services, specialist 
learning support, 
academic English, 
counselling services, 
wellbeing services, 
financial 
support, student mobility and chaplaincy. 
They also 
work
ed closely with external services 
relating to mental health, such as student health centre, local GPs, NHS Trusts, and local 
charities working 
on mental health related issues. 
They may also include, or work closely 
with
 other internal departments
, such
 as 
international student support, careers service, 
and nursery services. All of these services w
ere
 available to PGRs as registered students. 
Some 
PGRs 
were 
also able to access so
me staff services at some HEIs
, including staff registered 
on doctoral progr
ammes and PGRs employed as teaching assistants
.  2.3
 Crisis management
 All the case study institutions 
reported having
 well
-documented and robust frameworks and 
procedures for responding to an incident or crisis affecting staff or students, often including 
automatic notification of key personnel. PGRs experiencing a mental health crisis would 
automatically be covered with
in these procedures, most likely be referred 
directly 
to NHS 
services. Several institutions highlighted the effectiveness of security staff in dealing with 
crises.  
 2.4
 Declaring disabilities 
 Any
 PGR declaring a disability or mental health issue on registrat
ion or during their degree 
programme w
ould
 experience a well
-established process for accessing and providing for 
their specific needs
, in the same way that any other student declaring a specific condition 
that may affect their ability to study. This proces
s was usually managed by Student Sup
port 
Services or the Disability Centre
, who create a management plan in consultation with each 
13 Vitae, © 
2018 The Careers Research and Advisory Centre (CRAC) Limited
 individual, including communication with other relevant departments and services, and 
external GP and NHS services where 
appropriate.
 ‚My university have been very supportive since I disclosed my condition. I had not realised 
the support that was available until I did so.™
 One HEI reported that they had realised that their disability support processes were very 
teaching and lear
ning focussed and developed a disability support learning contract 
specifically for PGRs
. Another HEI noted that the implementation of disability support plans 
had been changed from recommended 
to compulsory
 actions 
to ensure they were enacted 
at departmental level
.  Support services staff at several institutions commented that when they 
were working with 
PGRs they c
ould
 be reluctant to give permission for their department or supervisor to be 
informed of their declared disability, thereby possibly 
limiting the specific support that
 could
 be provided directly relating to their research activities. This reluctance
 to tell others of 
mental health issues
, anecdotally more so
 than for other student groups
, was a re
-occurring 
theme in the interviews and f
ocus groups
 and may be linked to departmental cultures
. 2.5
 Admissions and induction
 Admission was seen as an opportunity to pre
-empt crisis situations. Some HEIs were explicit 
about their intention to use interviews to ensure that candidates 
were suited to do
ctoral 
study, not just academically but also the financial viability of their situation (particularly for 
self
-funded PGRs) or the potential impact on the rest of their lives. 
It was not possible to 
assess how uniformly candidates were asked within or acro
ss HEIs about any disabilities
 or 
specific personal circumstances
 and encouraged to disclose
.   It was common that PGR induction activities
, primarily run by the Graduate School
, would 
include elements on wellbeing either explicitly or implicitly through s
essions on 
managing 
expectations
, e.g. ‚what you can expect from your supervisor™, ‚what you can expect from 
your PhD studies
™.  Although the majority of PGRs
 participate in induction processes and 
therefore w
ould
 receive 
information about 
the pastoral and
 specialist 
support provi
ded by the 
HEI, some PGRs felt th
is 
was
 when they least need
ed them and 
they were 
unlikely to take 
much notice. 
‚At that point you are not in the greatest need of wellbeing™
. Furthermore, 
PGRs 
who start a
t different times of the year may miss out on this information
 altogether
.  ‚I would urge to provide obligatory services and information to doctoral students at the 
beginning of their PhD programme
.™ ‚The induction programme should include a session at the 
mental wellbeing place so that we 
are able to meet the individuals and understand how the process works.™
 2.6
 Online resources and signposting
 It is increasingly common for HEIs to have 
a dedicated o
nline 
section for PGRs 
that signpost
s wellbeing and mental he
alth 
resources
. These 
appeared comprehensive and 
accessible in all cases
. Although not specifically targeted at PGRs, a few HEIs ha
d developed ‚wellbeing maps™ that signpost
ed students to the range of resources 
provided by 
the HEI and 
within 
the immediate 
location to suppor
t their wellbeing. This included
 specialist 
student support services, hospitals
, GPs, but also sports facilities, parks,
 cafes and cultural 
locations. 
Two HEIs had developed 
electronic help points in central areas containing 
comprehensive
 information about mental health, hate crime, domestic abuse and a range of 
other highly sensitive areas that students and PGR
s may not wish to discuss face to 
face. 
 However, n
ot all PGRs reported good awareness of sources of support within their HEI. 
Des
pite promotion of services
, some 
PGRs 
reported 
feeling
 bewildered and ‚disoriented™ 
regarding numerous sources of support.
 One cause of confu
sion wa
s PGRs
™ perceptions of 
‚falling between student and staff™
. One reported that if they were taken ill during their 
14 Vitae, © 
2018 The Careers Research and Advisory Centre (CRAC) Limited
 doctoral research they should access the student services, but when employed as a 
teaching assistant they could access the staff 
services. 
 2.7
 Counselling services
 University counselling s
ervices provide
d a range of services to staff, students and PGRs 
including individual and group counselling ses
sions. At some HEIs they ra
n group 
workshops addressing specific stressors and promoting self
-help/self
-management 
approaches
, such 
as, 
cognitive behavioural th
erapy
, resilience and overcoming anxiety.
 Although all counselling services struggle
d to meet demands within 
their HEI, because PGR 
numbers we
re small in comparison with undergraduate numbers, 
demand from 
PGR
s was
 not viewed as a significant 
workload. 
There were examples from both PGRs and counselling 
services of increased demand from PGRs during the vacations when there was likely to be 
lower demand from undergraduates. One PGR reported waiting until the vacations to contact 
the counselling services as the
y knew how busy they were and they did not want to put 
additional demands on the service during term 
time.   
 HEI c
ounselling services are under strain
, not least 
because it can be hard to get a
 counselling 
appointment 
through 
local GP services
. Counsellin
g staff reported that staff and 
students p
refer
red
 help that 
was
 bespoke to 
academic pressures and the NHS mental health 
services 
Œ particularly counselling services 
Œ involve
d long waits.
 One PGR noted that due to 
the limit on HEI counselling sessions, 
they were not using the service ‚
in case my mental 
health is worse later and I need the sessions more
™. 
Several PGRs were complimentary 
about the service they had received from their counselling service.
 21% of respondents 
reported using the HEI counsellin
g service at least once a year, with female PGRs higher at 
26% than for male PGRs (18%). 
 2.8
 Chaplaincy
 All institutions ha
d a chaplaincy service that offer
ed a quiet space for reflection or
 a place to 
find community. It was
 usually non
-denominational and wel
come
d staff and students o
f all 
faiths or none
, and often provide
d listening services, medi
tation, events and courses, 
including mindfulness and countering loneliness.  
 PGRs had mixed reactions to using the chaplaincy services. Some reporting that it prov
ided 
‚warm and affectionate 
emotional support
™ and ‚
simply listened, without pressurising me™
. Others disliked the idea that it was associated with religion.
 14% of respondents agreed they 
would feel comfortable talking to 
the 
Chaplaincy service if they ha
d a mental health p
roblem, 
with 56% disagreeing
 (with the balance not knowing)
.   2.9
 Other p
astoral support
 Student u
nions all offer
ed advice services for students, including PGRs
, and had a PGR 
officer
. However, they all report
ed difficulties in engaging PGRs. This 
was
 supported
 by the 
pilot survey where only 11% agreed they would feel comfortable talking to the 
student 
union 
advice service if t
hey had a mental health problem 
with
 64% disagreeing.
 HEIs 
were exploring 
a range of 
options to support student wellbeing and mental health 
generally. This include
d student
-led initiative
s, such as being promoted by 
the charity
 Student Minds w
ho aim to empower students to look after their own mental health through 
peer support and campaign g
roups. Their Look After Your Mate
21
 programme encourages 
students to support friends. Other examples include introducing student mental health 
champions, buddy systems, 
and encouraging more participation in sports.
                                                   21 www.studentminds.org.uk/lookafteryourmate.html
 15 Vitae, © 
2018 The Careers Research and Advisory Centre (CRAC) Limited
 HEIs reported that staff in 
colleges
 and 
residential
 accommodation provided important 
pastoral support for students. W
ardens, 
college 
nurses
, porters and facility staff c
ould
 all be 
approached by PGRs or identify those at risk. 
 85% of respondents 
to the pilot survey 
agreed they were most likely to talk to their family 
and friends if they were experiencing a mental health problem. This was followed by their 
local GP (64%), the counselling service (60%), a mental health advisor (56%), and peers 
and colleagues (54%). 
 Female respondents were more likely 
than male PGRs 
to talk to their family and friends 
(88% cf 
83%); their local GP (67% cf 61%); the counselling service (65% cf 54%); and a 
mental health advisor (58% cf 54%). They were slightly less likely to agree that t
hey would 
talk to their supervisor (42%) and postgraduate tutor (25%)
, than male PGRs at 43% and 
28%, respectively. 
 International researchers are less likely to talk to the local GP (57%), counselling service 
(58%), and more likely to talk to their peers 
and colleagues (60%) than other 
researchers
.    2.10
 Supervision
 The first point of contact 
for PGRs was
 seen as the supervisor. 
Supervisors 
were expected 
to provide basic pastoral support
, but there wa
s widespread 
recognition among senior staff 
and support ser
vices 
that there wa
s variability in the quality of this. 
Supervisors were not 
included within the scope of the project and i
t was
 uncl
ear whether supervisors underst
ood what 
was required in th
eir
 pastoral role 
with respect to wellbeing and mental health
 in terms 
of being reactive when PGRs present
ed with an actual problem by directing them to relevant 
services
, and
 being proactive when they notice
d a problem. There were reports 
from 
professional 
support staff 
of academic
s declaring ‚
we don™t do mental healt
h™, arising from 
either 
disinterest in the wellbeing of their PGRs or concern
s that they 
were not qualified 
or 
confident enough 
to intervene
. In either case, 
this 
lack of engagement 
put more 
onus on 
the PGR to 
find appropriate services and 
report 
their
 problem. There 
were also 
isolated 
reports 
of academics engaging too deeply into wellbeing issues 
of their PGRs 
and not contacting 
professional 
support services early enough.   
 PGRs were
 also
 unclear about the extent to which the supervisor role 
was pasto
ral and 
whether to approach student support services directly or to go through their supervisor. This

 Supervisor training
 and development
 All HEIs under
stood the pivotal role that supervisors play
ed in supporting the wellbeing and 
mental health of PGRs, and the lack of support for supervisors in this role. Most HEIs ha
d compulsory training requirements particularly for new supervisors and their role in th
e wellbeing of PGRs 
was being incorporat
ed into this training. One HEI wa
s piloting 
compulsory CPD courses for supervisors to develop their approach to supporting the mental 
health and wellbeing of PGRs. Another HEI ha
d set up a supervisor network: wellbei
ng and mental health 
had been identified by the supervisors as an important topic for the network. 
Within their broader activities relating to wellbeing, 
some 
HEIs 
were also looking at their 
supp
ort for staff. One institution wa
s looking 
at supervisor™s we
llbeing specifically and how 
they 
were supported by the HEI. Some HEIs ha
d frameworks or ‚decision trees™ to guide 
staff in how
, and to what extent
, they can support ‚distressed students™.

 Other 
academic
 support
 The UK Quality Code
22
 indicates that every PGR should have a supervisory team, 
but accounts suggest
ed that this 
was
 not 
regarded as significant among either PGRs or staff. 
Second or co
-supervisors were only mentioned in the context of multi
-disciplinary research 
needs rather th
an personal support structures. 
Some HEIs provide
d a personal mentor as 
part of the supervisory team whom PGRs c
ould
 approach if they ha
d personal issues. 
Generally, PGRs in the focus groups talked more about their relationship with their 
supervisor than p
erceiving a supervisory team around them.
 Many HEIs mentioned the role of the 
postgraduate 
research 
tutor/
co-ordinator (or similar) 
in 
provid
ing
 support to PGRs at faculty or departmental level. This would normally be a part
-time role undertaken concurrent
ly with their academic role. The effectiveness of these roles 
was regarded highly among 
academic 
staff
, but less so by PGRs themselves. 
PGR 
perceptions of the availability and helpfulness of 
postgraduate
 tutors varied and there was a 
general 
view that thei
r position in the department (and the politics around this) 
could 
compromise
 their ability to give an
 honest opinion or intervene in situations where PGRs 
struggle
d with their supervisor relationship. 
PGRs expressed a reluctance to confide in 
postgraduate 
tutors as they were not confident that their concerns would be kept 
confidential.
 ‚The role of post
graduate tutor is really important and needs to be filled with someone who is 
able to deal with pastoral matters
.™ At several HEIs a
nnual progress reviews 
were regarded as a means of picking up issues at 
individual level but it 
was not clear whether they capture
d a full range of potential problems, 
particularly those involving supervision quality or difficult aspects of the PGR
-supervisor 
relationship. 
For sim
ilar reasons a
round
 confidentiality and potential negative consequences, 
PGRs 
reported 
reluctan
ce in 
rais
ing
 issues in these interviews and documents, even 
anonymously.
 2.13
 Graduate s
chool
s Graduate schools or doctoral schools/college
s generally ha
d responsibi
lity for the PGR 
experience, although specific functions differ
ed across HEIs. Their roles 
could 
include: 
administration; funding and fellowships; 
admissions and progression; quality assurance; 
researcher development programmes
; social hub. It 
could 
also i
nclude supervisor training. 
 In the case stud
y HEIs, graduate school involvement in the wellbeing and mental health of 
PGRs was predominately through pastoral care and the provision of wellbeing courses and 
activities through their researcher development p
rogra
mmes. As graduate school staff we
re 
likely to have the most contact with PGRs beyond their supervisory relationship, they 
were 
regularly approached by PGRs with wellbeing and other issues. Staff reported dealing with a 
wide 
range of i
ssues
: supervisor
y issues and finance being the most common. This 
experience ha
d in part led to the provision of 
some 
PGR
-specific wellbeing activities. 
Graduate 
schools often provide
d café facilities
, social space
s and organise
d social events to 
encourage PGRs to integrate
 into the PGR community
. As mentioned earlier, one HEI has a 
formal drop
-in service for PGRs. 
4% of 
all 
survey respondents reported that they contacted 
their graduate school about their mental health at least on
ce a year.

 Researcher development programmes
 Interventions to manage PGR wellbeing 
were mainly led by the graduate school and/or their 
researcher development programme. Typically these 
involved 
integrating wellbeing as an 
element into 
existing 
training pr
ogrammes
 or sessions which aim
ed to address the 
challenges of self
-directed study and, in doing so, foster
ed wellbeing by tackling the common 
causes of stress. Examples of courses include
d: ‚getting the most out of supervision™; 
‚surviving the viva™; ‚writ
ing and time management™.
 They also provide
d targeted wellbeing sessions, such as ‚self
-help™ techniques to manage 
stress 
e.g ‚mindfulness™
; ‚meditation™
; ‚building 
resilience™
; dealing with procrasti
nation™; 
and managing stress
. These 
were voluntarily attended and only a limited number of places 
were 
normally available.  HEIs reported that these 
wellbeing session
s were becoming increasingly 
popular. 
14% of survey respondents reported that they participated in wellbeing courses and 
activit
ies at least once a year.

 3 Factors affecting PGR wellbeing
 In this section we explore the 
factors that impact o
n the wellbeing and mental health of 
PGRs. 
The perception from PGRs 
was that mental health issues 
were very common, 
although the associated 
stigma 
could 
prevent
 them from discussing their difficulties. 
Support 
staff reported that
, in common with the general population,
 some PGRs could be 
approaching crisis point before they sought help, whereas early disclosure will generally 
result in better o
utcomes. 
 3.1
 Pressures of doctoral research
 The reluctance to a
dmit to any difficulties impacted
 on whether PGRs s
ought help for 
emerging or existing wellbeing and mental health issues. PGRs in the focus groups almost 
universally associated undertaking a doctoral degree with being a stressful experience, at 
least at some stage. 
Language wa
s routinely used by 
both academic a
nd professional 
staff 
that normalises 
this 
stress, for example ‚surviving™ 
the doctoral
 degree 
and ‚staying sane™. 
Common language around doctoral degrees 
included
 ‚a difficult and stressful experience™
; ‚everyone gets postgrad blues™
; ‚your second/third/f
ourth year is the worst™
; ‚writing up is the 
hardest part of the process
™. This 
language 
was
 translated by PGRs 
into the expectation that 
they we
re expected to be stressed: it becomes the norm. 
As noted earlier, s
tress is not 
necessarily
 negative and resil
ience is an 
important attribute for researchers. There is a link, 
however, 
between 
stress and poor wellbeing.
 ‚The attitude to mental health problems from senior faculty in my department is that it is an 
inevitable part of graduate life and that since most
 of us are going through it we can support 
each other. There is no incentive to change the status quo or to acknowledge that the 
causes of mental health problems can come from within the department itself.™
 The research degree training 
programme is a uniqu
e experience. Although HEIs have formal 
Codes of Practice and many have clear guidance on the rights and responsibilities of PGRs 
and supervisors, 
new 
PGRs 
can 
go through 
cultural shock 
and take time to adjust to 
the doctoral experience. The transition can
 be unexpectedly difficult 
for some
, for example 
coming from structured 
taught degrees to an environment where the rules are still mostly 
unwritten and the success criteria 
can be 
unclear
. Equally
, individuals coming back into the 
education system to do a doctoral degree can be unconfident of their abilities to do research 
and find 
the lack of structure un
-nerving. 
PGRs spoke of the frustration of not knowing if they 
were progressing and only gettin
g ‚critical™ feedback. ‚
I™ve come from an environment where 
it was very clear if you were doing well or not: it™s ill
-defined in the academic world
.™ Add to 
the mix the challenges of adapting to a new institution, new country or new language it is 
understa
ndable that some PGRs may doubt their ability to successfully complete their 
doctorate.  
 ‚It's hard to stay motivated when the only targets are on an annual basis (annual reports). 
You work hard but feel no sense of reward or achievement for what you've d
one...most likely 
until the end of 
three
 years when the thesis is submitted.™   
 Furthermore, especially within more prestigious institutions, PGRs also hear
d the refrain that 
‚we are one of the best institutions™; ‚we only take the best candidates™; ‚only
 the best will 
succeed;™ ‚you need to be the best in order to succeed in academia™
.  This 
can 
create an 
implicit environment where if an individual experiences any self
-doubt they 
could experience
 Imposter Syndrome: the feeling ‚that they are not 
intellige
nt, capable or creative despite 
evidence of high achievement
23
.   ‚The implicit and underlying stresses involved in the publish or perish paradigm, as well as 
imposter syndrome more broadly, make it so that most graduate students who used to love 
                                                 23 Clance, P.R. & Imes, S.A. (1978). The Impostor Phenomenon in High Achieving Women: Dynamics and 
Therapeutic Interventions.  Psychotherapy: Theory Research and Practice, 15, 241 247

 learning n
ow feel stressed and frantic about whether or not they are measuring up to the 
system's qualifications. This has a huge bearing on well
-being.™
 ‚Sometimes 
I have the feeling that people around me are too good and I am not as talented 
and as useful as other
 people.
™ Despite wider 
structures and support 
systems
, such as graduate schools, 
doctoral training 
programmes, faculty pastoral care activities
 and university student services, 
PGRs™ 
perceptions of institutional support 
were based 
their 
experiences at the
 ‚frontline™, 
i.e.
 their 
interactions with their supervisor
 and within the department. They 
saw 
the culture in their 
department as more indicative of the institutional attitude to the wellbeing of staff and 
students than the central 
institutional 
messages 
the
y receive
d. PGRs 
were aware that 
academics 
were also experiencing high level of stress. 
 Within this environment, it is not surprising that 
some 
PGRs 
may 
find it difficult to know 
whether they are experiencing the ‚healthy™ stress of being intellectuall
y challenged by their 
research degree experience or ‚unhealthy™ stress that is impacting on their wellbeing and 
requires intervention.  
 ‚At my institution
 it is not uncommon to stigmatis
e mental health. I was advised by several 
people in authority not to 
disclose it in certain circu
mstances as I could be stigmatis
ed and my complaints considered over
-worry
.™ 3.2
 Supervisory relationship
 The quality of the PGR
-supervisor relationship is central to the PGR experience and hence 
often central to their wellbeing
24
. Consistently, respondents to PRES are most positive about 
supervision within their research degree experience
, giving an 86% aggregate score 
(definitely agree and mostly agree) across the supervision scale (PRES 2107). They 
were 
most positive about supervis
ors having the skills and knowledge to support their research 
(92%) and slightly less positive about supervisors 
support
ing
 them 
to identify their individual 
training and development needs
 (76%). Currently, however, there are no specific questions 
in PRES 
about how well supervisors support PGR wellbeing and mental health.
 Specifically exploring the role of the supervisor in the wellbeing and mental health of PGRs, 
both the focus groups and staff interviews noted the stress associated with any difficulties i
n the supervisory relationship. 
There was consensus across staff interviews and PGR focus 
groups that difficult
y in the supervisory relationship was one of the most common reasons for 
wellbeing issues, 
often exacerbated by imposter syndrome. 
Professional s
upport services 
staff particularly commented that it was one of the most difficult circumstances to deal with, 
not least as PGRs 
were usually reluctant to give them permission to approach the 
supervisor. 
Academic and support s
taff generally 
felt that there
 was general reluctance 
within 
HEIs
 to tackle difficult supervisory issues. 
One PGR reported that they were advised 
by their department to request a change in department rather than supervisor ‚
as it was 
easier to explain it as a change in direction of the
 research than acknowledge a supervisory 
issue
™ with an 
individual academic. 
 A fear of compla
ining about or to supervisors was 
common
ly reported by PGRs in the focus 
groups
. Some PGRs 
perceive
d themselves in a powerless position: they didn™t want to 
chang
e their research and didn™t believe they could change how they are treated. As one 
PGR noted ‚
raising supervisory
 issues depends on how difficult you want to make your life
™. Some 
PGRs 
spoke of ‚
macho cultures
™ where raising the 
topic of wellbeing would be
 seen
 as 
a weakness.

 ‚Everyone in our lab has found our supervisor difficult to deal with. The supervisor regularly 
verbally abuses other students and staff but the nature of academic power means it™s difficult 
to do anything other than quit the PhD.™
 Eve
n where there is
 a positive 
and constructive relationship between the PGR and their 
supervisor, 
some 
PGRs 
express
ed reluctan
ce in 
rais
ing
 issues about their wellbeing and 
mental health
 with their supervisor
. Their perception 
was
 that admitting to being stressed 
could
 impact
 on their supervisor™s perceptions of 
their ability 
to achieve their doctorate. 
PGRs s
aw their supervisor 
as 
crucial in the likelihood of completing their doctorate
, providing 
access to the networks, and the re
ferences they need
ed to achieve their 
career ambitions
. One PGR 
also 
mentioned that they were ‚
reluctant to mention anything to their supervisor as 
I could see how stressed they were and I didn™t want to add to it™
.   However, t
here were 
also 
reports of ve
ry positive experiences from PGRs who had 
disclosed issues. 
 ‚I could not have been better supported. My supervisor and faculty took the view that 
whatever was going on with my PhD, my wellbeing had to come first, and they gave me 
whatever latitude I neede
d with deadlines. My postgrad tutor were absolutely phenomenal: I 
had immediate access to free and first class counselling, hardship support when the 
devastation of my paid work that the situation entailed meant I couldn't pay my fees on time, 
and accommod
ation support when the situation at home was so difficult I needed respite. 
With this incredible support I have maintained my PhD, and have not intermitted at all 
because my tutor, my counsellor and I decided this would make things worse for me. I'm 
workin
g hard to catch up on quite a lot of lost time but knowing that all these people have my 
back motivates me to succeed. I could not have asked for a better support structure.™
  Overall, most PGRs 
were positive about their contact with their supervisor. 76% 
of survey 
respondents agreed that they had ‚regular contact with my supervisor/s, appropriate for my 
needs™. This compares with 89% of PRES 2017 respondents who agreed to the same 
question.
 In the pilot survey 
42% of respondents
 agreed that they would feel
 comfortable talking to 
their supervisor if they 
were experiencing a mental health issue, such as anxiety or 
depression, with 45% disagreeing. There were no differe
nces by gender or nationality. 
Only 
27% would feel comfortable talking to their postgraduate tutor, with international PGRs being 
more comfortable at 30%. 
Women were slightly less likely to talk
 to their postgraduate tutor 
about their mental health 
at 25% than men (28%)
. 31% of responde
nts ha
d consulted their supervisor in relation to their mental health at least 
once a year. This 
was
 higher for female PGRs at 35% than for male PGRs (25%). 
International PGRs 
were more likely to have consulted their supervisor at least once a year 
at 34%.
 11% of female PGRs and 7% of male PGRs report
ed that they ha
d consulted their 
supervisor every few months or more frequently. 
International PGRs 
were more likely to 
have consulted their supervisor at least every few months at 
12% than UK nationals (9%)
.  Male PGRs were significantly less likely to use 
their 
informal networks to talk about their 
mental health, with 
58% of male PGRs report
ing
 that they had never consulted their peers 
and colleagues, while 29% had never consulted their family and friends abou
t their mental 
health, compared with 45% and 15% of female PGRs, respectively. 
43% of female PGRs
 had consulted their family and friends about their mental health at least several times a 
month, compared to
 25% of male PGRs
. This 
lower level 
use of 
informa
l support networks 
for the wellbeing of male PGRs is 
an important difference as generally 
men 
are 
less likely to 
talk about their feelings and 
three times more at risk of suicide than women

experiencing stress and anxiety does not necessarily lead to more serious mental health 
21 Vitae, ©

 problems, a
ccessing informal
 (and formal support
) before 
issues 
become critical is an 
important factor in reducing risk
25
. International PGRs we
re significantly 
more likely to have consulted their 
family and friends 
about their mental health
 than UK nationals,
 with 42% reporting they d
id this 
at least 
several 
times a 
month 
and around half of these report
ed consulting family and friends 
several times 
a week
.          3.3
 Financial 
concerns
 PGRs and staff highlighted f
inancial concerns as 
potential causes of stress
. For full
-time 
PGRs 
with fixed funding terms this 
may not 
become
 an issue until towards the end of their 
studies. Both staff and PGRs commented on the difficulty 
when 
the ‚writing up™ period 
extend
ed beyond the funding, particularly for those with three year funding. 
Although the 
Research Councils require doctoral proj
ects to be designed so that PGRs can submit within 
the funded period
26
, there 
was a presumption 
from staff and PGRs 
that the doctorate take
s more than three years
 and usually 
there w
ould
 be a period without funding
. HEIs 
exceptionally provide
d hardship fund
s for some PGRs in this position, but by no means for 
all. 
Part
-time PGRs 
may
 have taken a drop in income to study and 
are 
therefore more
 likely 
to have more finance issues
. One part
-time PGR reported juggling their doctoral studies with 
three jobs, includ
ing teaching at their HEI
. Staff noted that f
or r
ecent 
undergradua
tes their
 financial concerns 
may 
be compounded by 
the stress of high student debt. 
Costs of living 
may 
not have been anticipated
, particularly for international researchers
, or rise 
unexpect
edly
. As a result, f
unds may not be sufficient for PGRs to eat well or spend money 
on social activities or pastimes that relax them, contributing to poorer wellbeing.
  ‚Wellbeing of PhD students is often linked to our financial situation. I am a fully funded 
student with a scholarship 
that covers a maintenance grant and my fees, but this amounts to 
less than the minimum wage. I am expected to live in London and conduct lo
ng term 
fieldwork internationally on this money, which is impossible and leaves me relying on paid 
work that takes me away from my studies or emergency loans and grants. I am in a large 
amount of debt and the university is neither sympathetic nor able to h
elp. Similarly, there is 
no option of paid sick leave on this programme. I can interrupt my studies for a maximum of 
12 months but this means my funding is suspended. The knowledge that I cannot take paid 
time off, or if I have to take time off I have to w
ork to support myself, is a huge source of 
stress and anxiety to me.
™ 3.4
 Workload
 and control
 The nature and range of competing demands 
that PGRs juggle is diverse
. There 
may be 
large 
variation
s depending, for example
, whether they are a full
-time PGR, have a dual role 
as academic staff or 
other part
-time occupations
, or the stage 
they are at in 
their studies. 
Pressures to gain experience of publishing, teaching, presenting work at conferences and, 
more generally, acqui
ring the
 professional experience to position PGRs for their future 
careers can make it hard for them to prioritise. 
A PGR
 in a role
 that require
d them to teach 
as part of their contract (Graduate Teaching Associate) 
reported that they 
felt 
they were 
over
-working to the point of ‚
exploitation
™.  More generally
, a culture of 
long
-hours 
that encourages a blurring between work and 
personal time 
was
 pervasive. There appear
ed to be an assumption that PGRs w
ould
 have a 
poor work/life balance. 
It 
was
 the perception
 of PGRs that m
any supervisors expect
ed work 
to be completed outside traditional working hours on a routine basis and view
ed the working 
week as having 
seven days. 
The PGR
s report
ed feeling pressurised to produce results on a 
regular basis.

 ‚The organisational culture of my department does not prioritise the wellbeing of its students 
and researchers. The culture values working hard above all else, and makes it difficult to 
admit that you are experiencing difficulties. More needs to be done to
 set an expectation or 
reasonable work life balance 
- to combat the idea that working in evenings and weekends is 
"normal" and/or a sign of commitment.™
 3.5
 Harassment
 There were isolated examples 
from PGRs, and university welfare staff who had counselled 
affected PGRs, of sexual harassment from male supervisors towards some female PGRs. 
Counsellors described females putting up with uncomfortable remarks or overly familiar 
behaviour
 from supervisors for the sake of their career. Staff also reported that a minor
ity of 
male PGRs from some cultures 
could 
respond negatively to female supervisors/academics 
in positions of authority
. One PGR reported 
personal 
experiences of racial discrimination 
within the department throughout their doctoral studies.
 PGRs reported 
that support 
staff 
could
 struggle to 
resolve 
extremely sensitive situations of this 
nature
. In close
-working 
research teams cultural issues of this type can have 
a knock
-on for the atmosphere in a lab 
or office and affect other PGRs outside that working rela
tionship. 
 Harassment of a type that arguably sits in a greyer area was also reported, often involving 
expectations that PGRs attend
ed social events with their supervisor outside office hours, 
and even personal events such as family weddings. It is likely 
that this 
was
 a difference 
between what the supervisor perceive
d as being inclusive and the PGR perceive
d as 
being 
controlling or intrusive. As the weaker party in a power relationship PGRs, especially 
international researchers used to a more hierarchical 
structure, can find it hard to 
know when 
they can 
say no to supervisors.
 PGR respondents to the survey highlighted bullying and 
harassment as an important (additional) topic to cover on PGR wellbeing and mental health.
 ‚Bullying culture within departments 
(especially towards junior researchers) is an important 
issue in regards to mental health.
™ 3.6
 Other risk factors
 Interviews with careers advisors at several HEIs reported that they s
aw PGRs who 
were 
experiencing stress due to concerns about the next step in their careers. Overwhelmingly, 
if 
they d
id access their careers service, 
PGRs 
did so 
at a late stage in their doctoral studies. 
They also 
reported that 
some 
PGR
 enquiries relat
ed to their relati
onship with their supervisor 
and the perception of the support they ha
d from them
.  ‚One of the problems I hear about the most around me is that of loneliness. Not all 
universities seem to provide sufficiently for students and staff in this regard. But the
 main 
issue remains that of the uncertainty with regards to professional opportunities at the end of 
the PhD.™
 The Flanders study saw a link between confidence in career outcomes and wellbeing
, with 
PGRs 
highly 
interested in an academic career and 
a strong
 perception of achieving an 
academic career having lower risk of developing a mental health problem. The Cowling 
study on 
the 2013 and 2015 
PRES 
data 
found a link between career intentions and 
overall 
satisfaction
 with their research degree experience
, wit
h PGRs with academic career 
intentions more likely to have significantly higher levels of satisfaction (4.6%) compared to 
those seeking a career beyond academia.
 In the pilot s
urvey
, respondents who aspired to an academic career in higher education were 
significantly more likely never to have considered leaving or suspending their studies (50%)
, compared with 
respondents with all 
other career intentions (35%). Those 
who aspired to an 
academic career 
had considered leaving or suspending their studies
 at le
ast several times a 
month 
(18%) 
and had done so 
less frequently than PGRs with other career intentions
 (28%).   23 Vitae, ©

 4 PGRs p
otentially 
at risk of developing poor mental health
 In this section we explore the 
types of PGRs who are most likely 
to be at risk of 
deve
loping
 mental health issues
. 4.1
 International PGRs
 Among doctoral schools and faculty staff, discussions about
 which groups of PGRs are most 
vulnerab
le to developing poor mental health 
were often dominated by difficulties ex
perienced 
by international PGRs. Th
ere was recognition among staff that PGRs coming to the UK from 
countries with very different cultures c
ould
 struggle
 and were 
likely to 
experience a 
combination of risk factors
. International PGRs 
newly coming to the UK for their doctoral 
degree 
were likely to be vulnerable due to a combination of reasons, including their ability to 
adjust to a new culture, their existing cultural mores, finance, visas, 
family circumstances 
and potentially less access to 
family
 and friend support
. They may also be l
ess used to self
-directed learning in their undergraduate and masters courses than UK nationals. 
International offices 
typically 
were 
seen by staff as the main source of support for these 
PGRs. 
 International PGRs from some countries c
ould
 associate disclo
sure of mental health 
difficulties with stigma, weakness or shame so it 
was
 felt that the full extent of issues in 
some groups 
was
 not known.
 There was a view that potential difficulties, such as mental 
health problems or wider wellbeing issues that could 
result in suspension or termination of 
studies were 
also 
more likely to be hidden by international PGRs 
for fear of losing the right to 
remain in the UK
 on their 
Tier
 4 visas.
 This fear 
of potential deportation 
was said to underpin 
other anxieties about th
eir PhD more generally as any 
potential suspension of their studies 
(e.g. for performance
, finance or 
attendance reasons) was associated with the threat of 
losing the right to remain resident.
 PGRs originating from areas of civil unrest or war were viewed 
as extremely vulnerable
. There were 
examples 
of PGRs in these situations 
experiencing family bereavement and 
requiring 
support of an intensive nature.
 Similarly
, foreign government instability c
ould
 give 
rise to fear that government funds to support their 
PhD w
ould
 cease. In the case of Nigeria a 
run on the currency caused problems in fee payment
s which the university was left to 
resolve internally.
 A family
-funded PGR reported that they were left with no living expenses 
after the 
Nigerian 
Government stoppe
d all international currency transfers. 
 More generally
 HEI
s report
ed that vi
sa issues 
were numerous and complex and
, even when 
managed successfully
, could
 take up a disproportionate amount of staff time
 to secure 
and be stressful for 
the PGRs
.   ‚The progressively worsening immigration rules in the UK make our futures uncertain. 
Always being made to feel like we aren't wanted/welcome by these immigration rules does 
get in the way of feeling good about things.
™ International PGR 
respondents were 
just as
 likely to 
agree that they had regular contact with 
their supervisor/s
 as UK nationals
 (78% cf 77%). 
They 
were
 slightly
 more likely to agree that 
they had too much work to do (50% cf 46% UK nationals)

 Isolated PGRs
 Staff mentioned the cha
llenge of identifying PGRs who we
re struggling with their wellbeing if 
the PGRs we
re not spending much time at the institution or interacting with staff. They 
highlighted PGRs 
working on individual topics 
were 
at high
er risk of poor wellbeing than 
those working in research groups. 
Any stressors, such as supervisory issues, research 
deadlines or family pressures, c
ould
 be magnified if the PGR d
id not have good personal, 
peer and departmental support systems around them. PGRs working in isolation in the arts 
and humanities using archives and libraries for long periods, 
PGRs 
on fieldwork 
assignments and working on remote campuses were all mentioned as being at higher risk. 
One PGR who had spent a year in the field reported that they had found it a real struggle to 
adapt back into the departmental environm
ent on their return and that no
one sh
owed any 
understanding of why this was hard.  
  ‚Traumatic events during a PhD can have exacerbated mental health effects due to feeling 
of isolation engendered by the nature of solitary and self
-motivated research.™
 Even PGRs who we
re working in research 
groups c
ould
 feel a sense of isolation. 
Departmental administrators noted that they have had examples of PGRs who have been 
physically part of a large group, but effectively had withdrawn from any engagement with the 
rest of the group. The
y added that high
 presenteeism c
ould
 be as strong an indicator of poor 
wellbeing as absenteeism
. Research shows that fear and stress can drive productivity
, or 
drive the need to maintain an appearance of productivity
27
. PGRs working across interdisciplinary fields
 reported 
a sense of isolation as they d
id not feel 
they belong
ed to any particular department or school. They 
also 
reported 
feeling
 the need to 
be seen 
as ‚expert™ in each area
, thereby increasing the risk of imposter syndrome
. 54% of r
espondents to the pilot surve
y agreed that they would talk to their
 peers and 
colleagues
 if they are experiencing a mental health problem. This was slightly higher for 
female (56%) and international (60%) PGRs. Peer networks can be a valuable support for 
PGRs. There are a range of 
stu
dent initiatives 
within institutions 
that encourage peer 
support, such as Look After Your Mate
28
, Mind and Body Champions
29
, wellbeing 
champions
30
, and mental health first aiders
31
 that could be 
specifically 
targeted at
 PGRs. 
 One HEI noted 
the under
-representation of PGRs in sports membership and many 
staff 
commented that 
PGRs wer
e less likely to engage in out
-of-hours activities. This could arise

 from the long
-hours working culture, domestic responsibilities, and difficulties with work
-life 
balance. HEIs based in London highlighted the cost of accommodation forc
ed some 
PGRs 
to live long distances from the institution and add
ed to the risk of disengagement and sense 
of isolation.
 ‚Commuting distance (>90 minutes each way) is taking a great toll o
n my work
-life balance.™
 ‚I consider myself very happy, and I am lucky in having a great supervisor, but my 
satisfaction also comes from the many social activit
ies I am participating in
– I think a lot of 
foreign students, isolated from their family and fri
ends, often lack an alternative to their work, 
and encouraging more social/sports/artistic/whatever activities could go a long way in 
improving mental health.
™ Cohort training
 There 
was
 some evidence 
from the 
pilot survey of the benefits of cohort training
, such as the 
Research Councils 
UK 
Doctoral Training
 Programmes and Centres for Doctoral 
Training
. A 
third of respondents said they were based in 
a research training programme
, compared to 
17% in PRES 2017
. These respondents were more likely to agree that 
they had regular 
contact with their supervisor/s (80% cf 75%
; PRES 2017 89%
); ha
d frequent opportunities to 
discuss their research with other research students (70% cf 61%
; PRES 2017 66%
); and that the research ambience in their 
department or faculty 
stimulated
 their work 
(63% cf 
57%; PRES 2017 63%
) - compared to the 68% of respondents who were not based in a training 
programme (or didn™t know). 
 Respondents in training centres were more likely to agree that their workload was varied 
(67% cf 61%); ever
yone™s opinions were taken
 into account when decisions are made in the 
research unit; their main supervisor encourage
d people to maximise their talents (75% cf 
69%) and more likely never to have thought about suspending or leaving their doctoral 
degree pro
gramme (46% cf 40%). 
They were more likely to have a career development plan: 
50% compared with 
39% of 
other respondents.
 There was little difference between respondents who were based in a training centre and 
other respondents in terms of their 
workload a
nd work
-life balance.
 70% of respondents in training centres agreed that 
they pay 
regular 
attention to their 
wellbeing and mental health
, compared to 65% of other respondents. They were also more 
likely to agree that t
heir institution 
cares about 
PGR wellb
eing and mental health
 (45% cf 
38%) and know where to go if they any issues with their mental health (63% cf 58%)
.  45% of respondents in training centres
 also
 would feel comfortable talking to their supervisor 
if they were experiencing a common mental hea
lth problem, compared to 40% of other 
respondents. They also would be more likely to talk to the departmental/research group 
administrator (16% cf 13%). Similar proportions report participating in wellbeing courses or 
activities (16% cf 13%). 
 Respondents 
at training centres were more likely to be UK national
s (57%
 cf 41%) and less 
likely to be international PGRs (16% cf 30%) than other respondents
, likely 
reflecting the 
restricted eligibility conditions for RCUK funding
.  4.3
 Part
-time PGRs
 Staff
 across instit
utions
 consistently reported that part
-time PGRs 
were likely to be more at 
risk of poor wellbeing and mental health issues th
an full
-time researchers. This wa
s because 
they 
were likely to experience multiple risk factors, such as financial issues
 and work
-life 
balance, 
as well as more universal issues 
such as
 imposter syndrome. 
 ‚I am unfunded, work and study part
-time and also have small children so this is obviously 
more stressful than being a full
-time funded student.™
 26 Vitae, ©

 Mature researchers who come b
ack into academia to undertake their doctorate, usually part
-time, were usually clear about why they are doing their doctorate, well
-motivated and knew 
how manage themselves 
and to structure their time
. Mature part
-time researchers
, however,
 also 
could
 feel isolated
 because of their circumstances
.  ‚As an individual who does not have any fellow students of a similar age, but who is the age 
of many staff members, I experience feelings of loneliness as I do not feel that, for example, 
university society
-based
 activities are suited to mature students (rightly so), and my 
university 
is remote from my family home. 
Therefore, I think the impact of loneliness and/or 
feelings of isolation should not be underestimated for mature students.™
 Part
-time PGRs 
could 
also b
e members of staff
 who 
were undertaking a doctorate. This 
group was more commonly mentioned at the three non
-Russell Group institutions
. Undertaking a doctorate as a staff member
 create
d challenges 
for staff 
in terms of role and 
identity, but also practical issues in 
terms of 
juggling their different roles and managing 
workload priorities. PGRs in this role, particularly those with established 
academic 
careers 
often have different drivers. Where the doctorate 
is a CPD requirement of their institution 
and a prerequisite for their continued career progression there can be mixed feelings about 
embarking on the 
doctorate
.  ‚As a member of University staff (as well as a PhD student) my wellbeing is affected more by 
the lack of understanding of colleagues than by the organisation of my PhD. There is huge 
pressure to maintain a heavy teaching compon
ent throughout my PhD studies. 
The management of the workload allocation supports this and it is having a very destructive
 effect on my research progress.™
 At 8% of respondents, t
he number of part
-time PGRs 
who 
participat
ed in
 the pilot survey 
was too small to undertake any analysis of the wellbeing and mental health experiences 
of this cohort.
 4.4
 PGRs with family responsibiliti
es   
 PGRs with family responsibilities could experience challenges with their work
-life balance. 
There were isolated examples in the focus groups of PGRs who had developed mental 
health issues as a result of managing 
the health 
of or other issues 
concerni
ng their children 
or elderly parents during the
ir doctoral studies. 
For one PGR
 it resulted in a 
subsequent 
suspension of their 
studies.
 In the survey 11% of respondents had children living with them 
or whom they were supporting
.    ‚As a mature student the sources of any family issues that concern me are distinctly different 
from other students and come with different pressures, e.g. bereavement, job losses, 
marriage preparations, 
home moving, etc.
™   Additionally, i
t is likely 
that some PGRs will start or increase their family during their doctoral 
programme. As well as pressures on work
-life balance, this can result in financial anxieties 
particularly 
if
 funding 
ceases 
during maternity 
or paternity 
leave. Given the diversity of
 research funders™ terms and conditions, 
the entitlement of PGRs to maternity and paternity 
leave
, and continued funding, 
is not always clear
. As PGRs (generally) do not have 
employee status they may not be able to access, or know they can access, HR suppo
rt to 
get advice about leave 
of any kind (maternity, paternity, sickness, compassionate, 
emergency)
. Several PGRs noted that they were not aware that they were entitled to any 
maternity leave during their doctoral studies. 
There were also isolated accounts of 
supervisors reacting negatively (covertly or overtly) to PGRs who became pregnant. 
 ‚I have found it quite stressful being pregnant and not having maternity leave guidelines or 
support in place. At first I was told I wo
uld only get 2 weeks off and had to really dig and wait 
a couple of months until a decision was made to allow me 16 weeks' leave. It made me quite 
anxious and I felt there was no support in place, especially with my supervisors trying to get 
me to finish a
s much work as possible before I go off.
™ 27 Vitae, © 
2018 The Careers Research and Advisory Centre (CRAC) Limited
 For international PGRs this could be further complicated by T
ier
 4 visa requirements where 
taking time out of studies for maternity leave could require them to leave the UK during this 
period. 
The Home Office requi
res HEIs to cancel a Tier 4 visa if a leave of absence is for 
more than sixty days, except in exceptional circumstances (illness or injury) where this can 
be extended to four months. 
UKCISA and i
nstitutional guidance was generally unclear 
whether this incl
uded maternity leave or not
32
. One HEI provided 
several examples of 
supervisors/staff not being aware of a pregnancy until 
a late stage (or in one case following 
birth)
 because of PGRs™ fear it would 
result in deportation from the UK. 
 4.5
 Specific learning dis
abilities
 It was not possible to get a clear picture 
in the case studies 
of the prevalence of specific 
learning disabilities in the
ir PGR cohort
s relative to the
ir undergraduate 
population
 and this 
was not explored in the pilot survey. Student support serv
ices staff 
reported that international 
PGRs 
wer
e unlikely to declare anything at all. As widely established in the undergraduate 
literature, disability staff at HEIs reported a tendency for anxiety to co
-occur for PGRs with 
dyslexia, dyspraxia and 
autism s
pectrum disorder
. As with all students, PGRs with declared conditions/disabilities 
were able to access 
reasonable adjustments and support to help them engage in their studies through HEI
-wide 
disability services. Some HEIs ha
d developed systems/documents s
pecifically tailored to 
PGRs. UK PGRs 
could a
lso be eligible for Disabled Students™ Allowances (DSAs). 
 There were reports that supervisors c
ould
 be more amenable to adjustments requested for 
PGRs than for undergraduate
 students
. It was
 unclear whether this was
 because of the 
nature of the adjustments or because the quality/intensity of the working a
rrangement with 
their PGRs helped
 supervisors to understand the potential benefits of any adjustment

 5 Extent of mental health issues
 The focus groups involved only a very small sample of PGRs
 and, although useful in 
exploring the range of wellbeing issues experienced by PGRs, 
it was not possible to get a 
view of the extent of mental health issues within the PGR population through the
se 
inter
views
. Furthermore, n
one of the HEIs collated information across the HEI to provide an 
overview of the proportion of PGRs using the range of institutional wellbeing and mental 
health services, thereby providing some indication of the level of demand from t
he PGR 
cohort. 
Student support services 
at all HEIs record
ed the use of their services by students
 and most, 
when
 asked
, were able to identify the number of PGRs who 
were accessing their 
specific 
services. 
However,
 aggregated statistics 
were not readily av
ailable 
to show 
the specific characteristics (full
-time, part
-time, international) 
of PGRs 
who 
use
d particular 
support services, the type of problems they present
ed with and their severity
. In terms of the 
impact on the doctoral experience and outcomes, 
it 
would be 
useful 
to systematically record 
the percentage of suspensions or terminations of doctoral study due to mental health issues. 
 Several HEIs mentioned 
PGR 
annual review meetings and progress reviews as an 
opportunity to highlight 
and record 
any w
ellbeing issues. However, these reviews typically 
focus on performance so PGRs may be unwilling to talk about any wellbeing issues if they 
feel it will reflect badly on how their progress is viewed. They also may be concerned about 
the confidentiality of a
ny conversations or reporting processes. There is only a real 
opportunity for disclosures around wellbeing to happen on these occasions if the culture is 
one of trust and openness.
 PRES 2017 included a 
new optional section on personal outlook, including a 
question on
 whether PGRs had considered
 ‚leaving or suspending
 your postgraduate course
™ with a 
yes/no answer
. PRES 2017 was run by 117 institutions and achieved a 46% response rate, 
representing 53% of the UK PGR population, so the results can be seen as 
meaningful.
  26% of respondents 
had considered leaving or suspending their studies. 
Although there was 
no way of distinguishing whether there were positive or negative reasons for considering 
leaving or suspending, the results could be taken as an indicati
on of the level of ‚happiness™ 
with their research degree experience. 
These considerations could be important warning 
signs of vulnerability and ideally supervisors could 
regularly 
ask open questions to explore 
these feelings and signpost to appropriate su
pport as necessary
, particularly for at risk 
groups
.  Analysis
 of the PRES results
33
 showed that 
PGRs 
considering leaving or suspending their 
studies 
was
 related to their ‚satisfaction with life nowadays™ and their work
-life balance. 
There was also 
a relati
onship 
with
 disability status, gender and mode of study. 
Those 
respondents 
who 
stat
ed they ha
d a disability 
were 
almost twice as 
likely to consider leaving 
or suspending 
(48%) 
than those without. This increased to 60% for respondents with a 
mental 
health 
condition
. 36% of part
-time respondents and 29% of female respondents had 
considered leaving or suspending their studies. PGRs who ha
d a career development plan 
and had received training to develop their research skills were less likely to 
have 
considered 
leaving or suspending their studies 
at 22% and 24%, respectively, 
than those who had not
 (30% and 35%)
.  In the pilot 
survey 
this question was extended to explore how 
frequently 
PGRs had 
considered suspending or leaving their doctoral training programme, 
with options ranging 
from: ‚never™; ™
at least once or twice a year
™ to ‚every day
™. 58% of respondents had 
considered
 leaving or suspending their studies
 at some time, 
twice the level of PRES, 
with 
14% of respondents consider
ing
 leaving or suspending their 
studies
 at least several times a 
month
.                                                   33 Postgraduate Research Experience Survey, HEA, 2017

 6 Conclusions and recommendations
 With the formation of 
UKRI
 in 
April 2018, 
HEFCE™s responsibilities for PGRs 
were 
incorpora
ted into Research England, who 
share responsibility for PGRs in English HEIs with 
the Office of Students (OfS). 
UKRI 
should collaborate with the 
OfS
, other funding bodies, 
Universities 
UK 
and other stakeholders to take forward these recommendations to ensure a 
healthy and supportive research environment for postgraduate researchers.
 6.1
 Cultural change
 For HEIs to 
provide a safe working environment for PGRs that supports their wellbeing and 
mental health
, systemic culture change is needed by the sector. 
The academic culture of 
high
-achievement, 
expectations of 
high workloads and not displaying any weaknesses 
can 
mitigate 
against PGRs 
feeling
 this is a safe environment where they can talk about their 
wellbeing.
 Institutions need to find ways to 
support PGRs to 
disconnect the ‚healthy stress™ 
related to the intellectual challenge of undertaking a doctorate from othe
r stresses that have 
a negative impact on wellbeing and mental health.
 Achieving c
ultural change requires a top
-down commitment 
within
 HEI
s to promoting mental health. The Universities UK Framework 
for Mental Health proposes a whole university approach tha
t ‚requires strong and strategic 
leadership, engagement of multiple constituencies and partners
, and sustained prioritisation™. 
This generic 
framework, supported by
 useful 
resources on the UUK website, covers the key 
elements in achieving cultural change t
hrough a holistic approach (
Appendix 
1). The Framework and associated resources 
usually 
could 
be translated to reflect the PGR 
environment. This will provide HEIs with the means to 
develop an effective strategy and to 
take a concerted approach to promoting
 better wellbeing, preventing mental health issues 
and providing effective interventions for PGRs. 
 6.2
 Supervision
 As the first point of contact for PGRs
 and effectively performing the line management role for 
PGRs, 
supervisors 
have an 
important role in suppo
rting their wellbeing and mental health
 and need more specific guidance on this role
. The recent Government review
34
 on creating 
healthy, inclusive workplaces, stressed the importance of the line manager role, highlighting 
that ‚line managers lack the train
ing, skills or confidence required to effectively support 
others at a very basic level™
.  Among non
-specialists
 in mental health
, as the majority of supervisors 
will be
, there can be a 
lack of nuanced awareness of mental health, i.e. that everybody sits on
 a continuum at any
 time between being well (wellbeing) and being unwell (having a condition that interferes with 
work and functionality more generally). Supervisors 
potentially are 
uniquely positioned to 
notice when their PGRs slip the wrong way on that s
pectrum
 as 
spotting subtle signs of 
distress often requires knowing what is ‚normal™ for that particular person
. They need to be 
sensitive and confident about 
initiating a conversation and follow
ing
 up appropriately. This is

 Recommendation 1: 
UKRI
 should work with UUK, other stakeholders and the HE sector 
to conte
xtualise the

environment. 
 Recommendation 2: HEIs should develop institutional strategies to support the wellbeing 
and mental health of PGRs

ramework.

 and when to seek help
).  ‚I think supervisors should receive some training to spot mental health problems arising. In 
my case, in hindsight, my supervisor could pr
obably have noticed that I was developing 
problems much earlier than I did, and advised me to see someone, say, the University 
Counselling Service
.™ HEIs need to provide 
all 
supervisors with training in mental health literacy. This can mean 
challenging mis
taken beliefs about the causes of mental health problems and questioning 
assumptions about the ‚type™ of person who is prone (or not prone) to being affected. Due to 
the stigma and unease around mental health, there is a risk that even well
-meaning 
supervi
sors will 
avoid or mismanage mental health issues. It is essential to equip these 
‚people managers™ with the skills they need to identify, discuss and effectively deal with any 
problems 
experienced by 
PGRs. 
NICE provide 
useful 
guidance on the role and lead
ership 
styles of line managers in supporting mental wellbeing
35
. Those who can cultivate an open 
and honest relationship are much better placed to pick up on problems. If a line manager 
has 
effective 
people
 skills then 
members of their team are
 more likely 
to disclose that they 
are struggling with (for example) anxiety, and to disclose this sooner rather than later.
 Supervisors need to be knowledgeable about HEI support services and how PGRs can 
access them. 
They also need to be better equipped to work with 
specialist professionals to 
make reasonable adjustments to support PGRs
 where necessary. 
This should include 
supporting PGRs who have taken a suspension due mental health problems
 to re
turn to their 
studies at an appropriate time and in a manner that will 
not compromise their recovery
. The balance of power between the PGR and the supervisor is such that some PGRs may be 
reluctant to raise wellbeing issues with their supervisor as they perceive that it may reflect 
badly on their ability to complete their doc
torate. 
Concern about the reaction of supervisors 
can lead to some PGRs treating messages from the institution on its commitment to 
supporting their wellbeing with suspicion, seeing them as ‚
window
-dressing™
 or ‚
smoke and 
mirrors™
. The influence of the academic culture and the perceived power of the supervisor 
also can prevent PGRs from seeking 
support from appropriate, confidential services in case 
this information ‚
gets back to my supervisor™
. More guidance and provision is needed 
for 
both PGRs and supervisors that directly address imposter syndrome and its impact on 
wellbeing.
  Although the vast majority of supervisory relationships will be 
positive and effective,
 supervisor behaviour can be a cause of significant distress
 for 
a mi
nority of 
PGRs
, despite 
the assumed 
supervisor 
role as supporter and mentor.
 HEIs need to be prepared to deal 
robustly with any issues relating to the supervisory relationship, ensuring that individual 
occurrences are dealt with promptly, transparently and
 fairly for all parties. In any 
discussions individual PGRs need to feel that they are supported by someone independent 
and primarily have their interests at heart.
 Institutions 
also 
need to consider the role and 
effectiveness of postgraduate 
tutors and 
mentors in providing
 independent and confidential
 support throughout the doctoral programme.
 There is some evidence coming through the 
survey that 
those 
PGRs in cohort training and with access to wider support networks are 
more likely to discuss issues relat
ing to their mental health. 
 Supervisors also need to feel that their own wellbeing and mental health is a priority for the 
institution so they can be role models 
to their PGRs 
in healthy ways of working.
 HEIs also 
need to reflect 
the supervisor
™s role
, and that of postgraduate tutors,
 in PGR wellbeing in job 
descriptions
, performance reviews, 
and promotion and progression 
systems. 
Unless 
academic staff see that their HEI is genuinely committed to providing a healthy environment 
and it is impacting on their
 working experiences, they are unlikely to prioritise their role in 
                                                 35 Workplace health: management practices, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)

 ensuring the wellbeing an
d mental health of their PGRs. 
PGRs need to know that they are in 
an institutional and local culture that fosters wellbeing and there is an expectation on 
supervisors that the
ir role involves a duty of care. 
 Although some of the
 academics interviewed in the case studies were active supervisors, 
supervisors generally were not included as a target group
 in this project
. There would be 
value in specifically exploring in more depth the views and experiences of supervisors
 through a
 future 
targeted 
project
, particularly their perceptions of their role in supporting the 
wellbeing and mental health of PGRs
, how capable they feel in that role
 and examples of 
good practice
. This 
should include the role of the supervisory team
 and postgradu
ate mentor
s, 
and the value of 
cohort training and wider support networks
 in supporting 
PGR 
wellbeing.
  6.3
 Engagement
 PGRs s
aw themselves as a distinct cohort compared to the undergraduate body and 
were 
not relating to messages 
targeted 
more generally 
at the student body. To support the 
wellbeing of the PGR community, HEIs need to provide communications and interventions 
targeted directly at PGRs. 
They also 
need to consider the
 diversity of backgrounds: gender, 
cultural background
s, personal circumstances
 and departmental cultures
 which can make a 
difference to both mental health and the propensity to disclose problems. Financial 
circumstances, life events and domestic arrangements can all contribute as risk factors. 
 HEIs need to consider how best to connect w
ith and provide support for at risk groups, 
particularly international PGRs, part
-time PGRs and those PGRs who are not 
included in 
cohort
 training 
model
s. More information and guidance should be provided to minimise the 
likelihood of PGRs becoming stressed
 by changes in circumstances during their doctoral 
training programme. For example, HEIs need to publish clear policies on maternity and 
paternity leave for all PGRs, taking into account funding and visa conditions
 where 
necessary. This should include 
a contact 
point
 responsible for dealing with and monitoring 
requests
. More could be made of existing 
PGR 
services
, such as graduate schools and researcher 
development programmes 
and the use of cohort training programmes 
to promote 
and improve 
wellbeing and mental health related provision for PGRs. 
HEIs should
 also
 expl
ore 
how they can encourage 
PGR 
peer support networks
, more structured PGR cohorts or 
communities
 and PGR champions that specifically focus on wellbeing and mental health. 
  Recommendation 3:
 UKRI
 should commission a project that explores how supervisors 
and postgraduate tutors perceive their role in supporting the wellbeing and mental health 
of PGRs 
and identifies the p
rinciples of good management practice that are applicable to 
the supervisory relationship.
 Recommendation 4: 
HEIs
 should develop robust procedures for monitoring supervisory 
relationships and providing timely, transparent and fair mechanisms for dealing wi
th supervisory issues. 
 Recommendation 5: Supervisors and postgraduate tutors should be trained, supported 
and recognised for their role in the identification and early intervention 
in 
wellbeing 
and 
mental health 
issues 
of their PGRs.
  Recommendation 6: As part of their strategic plan for PGR wellbeing, HEIs should 
develop communication strategies to promote points of entry into student support 
services specifically to 
PGRs.

 6.4
 Demand
 There 
was
 consensus across HEIs that
, alongside the increase at undergraduate level, 
they 
were seeing an overall rise in PGRs struggling with their 
mental health. In the absence of 
hard statistical data, however, this 
was
 coming from impressions or localised experiences. 
There 
was
 no consensus as to 
whether this 
was
 a real increase, or evidence of a more 
acceptable environment encouraging PGRs to talk about their wellbeing and mental health. 
More could be done 
by HEIs 
to collate and analyse existing throughput data on PGR use of 
wellbeing and mental health services.
 It would also be useful to explore PGR use of staff 
services. 
 Demand and activity data is critical in enabling HEIs to develop appropriate strategies and 
prioritise budgets. The Thriving at Work report
34 called for tran
sparency and accountability 
about mental health and recommended that ‚
public sector employers should identify 
employees at higher risk of stress or trauma and produce a national framework which 
coordinates support for these employees and establishes clear 
accountability for their mental 
health™
. The aim of the pilot survey was to establish a method by which to measure the extent of 
mental health problems experienced by PG
Rs. Although the pilot survey did not 
provide
 a representative response sample
 to assess demand
, it has demonstrated how it could 
provide useful insights into the wellbeing and mental health of PGRs. The next step would 
be a more extensively resourced full
 survey, potentially using a sample approach, with the 
time, resources and promotion to obtain data with the confidence that it is representative of 
the true extent of PGR mental health problems in the UK. 
  6.5
 Resources
 Those PGRs who do formally disclose 
mental health conditions 
are likely to receive good 
support. However, counselling services are 
increasingly 
under strain from 
demand at 
undergraduate level and NHS services are also highly stressed 
with
 mental health and 
counselling services particularly inv
olv
ing
 long waits. HEIs need to invest more resources in 
student support services and particularly mental health and counselling services. 
 Investment is also needed for associated activities, such as increasing 
mental 
health literacy 
and prevention activities targeted
 specifically at PGRs and supervisors.  
    Recommendation 7: As part of their strategic plan for PGR wellbeing, HEIs should 
monitor the extent of mental health issues for PGRs and demand for associated services
. Recommendation 8: 
UKRI
 should extend the pi
lot survey to achieve a representative 
response sample to assess the extent of mental health issues in the UK PGR population. 
  Recommendation 9: HEIs need to consider how they resource their student support 
services and other relevant depar
tments to support the wellbeing 
and mental health 
of 
PGRs, particularly activities aimed at prevention and early intervention.

 6.6
 Sharing practice
 HEIs 
were at an early stage in developing
 their strategies for PGR wellbeing and mental 
health: creating specific 
wellbeing information and guidance
 and developing targeted 
wellbeing activities for PGRs and supervisors
 within the context of
 existing 
professional 
development programmes. There is m
uch to be gained from 
creating
 mechanisms for 
sharing practice 
and experiences 
across 
the sector
. The recent Catalyst Fund
36
 call was 
specifically targeted at supporting the mental health and wellbeing of PGRs
 and has been 
widely welcomed by the sector
. Res
earch England 
could play a valuable role in facilitating 
successful bidders wherever possible to work together and work in an open manner with the 
sector such that the learning is shared as widely 
and as early as po
ssible in the projects. 
This on 
going sha
ring could be through open access project websites or specifically 
organised practice
-sharing events throughout the course of the project lifetime
s. Additionally 
Research England and 
UUK should seek case studies of wellbeing and mental health 
policies and 
interventions 
from the sector that 
have resulted in improved PGR outcomes and 
examples of practice from other sectors that could have applicability for PGRs. Encouraging 
openness has the potential to benefit the eventual outcomes of the
 Catalyst
 projects
, and sector knowledge 
and practice 
more generally.

 Recommendation 10:
 UKRI and the OfS
 should facilitate practice
-sharing mechanisms 
around the Catalyst Fund projects and the sector generally, particularly encouraging case 
studies of where improved mental health resulted in improved PGR outcomes.

 Appendix 
3: Survey m
ethodology
 As part of the project, all ten case
 study HEIs were invited to participate in a pilot survey 
designed to identify the extent of mental health issues within the PGR population. 
The 
survey asked about PGRs™ wellbeing and who they would approach and what services they 
would access if they had 
mental health problems. It explored factors that were likely to 
impact on their wellbeing, including their views of their workload and work freedom, their 
work
-life balance, and their career intentions. The survey included five questions from the 
PRES surv
ey for comparison. 
It collected a range of demographic information and study 
characteristics. 
 Six HEIs participated in the survey between October and December. 
Other HEIs were 
unable to participate due to the timing of the survey, 
overlap with induction a
ctivities, 
available resources or conflict
s with other surveying activities
 in the institution
. Ethical 
approach was granted through one of the participating HEIs. 
 A combination of approaches was used to contact PGRs. Two HEIs 
were able to 
provide 
PGR ema
ils 
enabling t
he project team 
to email PGRs directly and use survey access control 
to follow up on non
-respondents. The other HEIs emailed PGRs directly: three using survey 
access control and one 
HEI 
using a global survey link. 
 1,857 complete responses we
re obtained, representing a 
poor
 overall response rate 
of 14% (Table 2)
, compared to PRES response rate at 46%
. The response rate to the pilot survey
 varied across the HEIs, but 
was 
generally low at all institutions
 (10% 
- 18%)
. There was no 
correlation be
tween response rates and 
the method of contacting PGRs. The response rate 
was likely influenced by the timing of the survey, which 
ran very early in the academic year, 
when many PGRs are getting back into their studies after the summer holidays
.  Survey fa
tigue is a common refrain for all 
HE 
populations
 and 
PRES had run in 2017 during 
February
-May with associated promotion campaigns
. PGRs in the focus groups expressed 
cynicism about institutional surveys and felt that they tended to be used for marketing 
activities rather than prompts for action.
 In the short timescale of the project, n
one of the 
HEIs had the resources to be able to provide the 
level of 
promotion needed to achieve high 
response rates
 for this difficult to reach group
. Some HEIs provided 
advance 
notice to PGRs 
and departments
 about the project and survey. 
 The low response rate resulted in an unrepresentative profile of respondents when 
compared to both the profile of the HEIs™ populations and the overall UK PGR population. 
This lack of re
presentation was reflected in all demographic and study characteristics. A
s in 
most surveys, women were over
-represented at 60% of the respondent sample compared to 
40.3% of the HEIs population and 47.8% of the UK population. Part
-time PGRs were 
significan
tly under
-represented at 8.3% 
compared to 16.9% of the HEIs population 
and 
prevented any analysis of this cohort. UK nationals and international PGRs were slightly 
under-represented (46.5% and 25.3%, respectively), with EU nationals significantly over
-repr
esented at 28.2%. 
 Disciplinary representation was more balanced, with a slight over
-representation of REF 
Panel A (medicine, health and life sciences) PGRs and under
-representation of Panel B 
(physical sciences, engineering and mathematics) compared to th
e HEIs PGR population. 
First year PGRs were still in the first weeks of their doctorate and response rates from these 
PGR
s were understandably very low at 
18.7% compared to 42.9% of the HEIs population
. Conversely, 
representation from PGRs in their fourth 
year was 
significantly higher 
(20.1%) 
than that in the HEIs™ population 
(6.2%) 
and the overall UK population
 (8.7%)
. Similarly, the 
age profile of the response sample was older than the HEIs and UK populations, with 
significantly more respondents in the 26
-35 age group (52.1%) and correspondingly 
fewer 
aged 25 years old and younger (28.5%). 
7% of respondents reported that they have a 
disability, which is similar to both the HEIs and UK populations.

 doctorate.
 This preference for those with wellbeing issues to engage in the pilot survey was 
also seen to some extent in PGR participation in the focus g
roups.  
 Due to the combination of these factors, the
 results of the pilot 
survey
 should not be taken as 
indicative of the prevalence of PGR mental health issues within the relevant HEIs, or in any 
way of the wider PGR population. Similarly, we strongly ad
vise against applying the reported 
findings to estimate demand for specialist support services in the PGR population. 
However, 
as a pilot 
the survey
 does provide an insight into 
PGR
 views and experiences 
of wellbeing 
and mental health 
that can be explored 
through a survey instrument
. Selected
 data on the 
experiences of PGRs
 with different demographics and mode
s of study are reported where 
relevant.
