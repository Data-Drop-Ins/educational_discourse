 2  The 
Good Supervisory Practice Framework
 acknowledges, for 
the first time at a 
national level
, the 
wide
-ranging
, highly 
complex
 and 
demanding set of roles
 involved in 
modern 
research supervisors.
  Research supervision is an increasingly complex activity, in which supervisors are 
having to respond to the growth, diversification and welfare of the PGR candidate 

population. However, training and development opportunities at many UK 

universities are limited, sometimes to only half a day (see Taylor 2018). This can 
leave many supervisors feeling undervalued and overwhelmed by the scale of 
their task
 and reduces the 
scope of 
those responsible for academic development
.  The framework is designed to set expectations for all supervisors and to support 
supervisor development programmes. The framework is informed by the academic 
research into doctoral education and has 
been validated during a pilot study involving 
research supervisors across the UK.
  
How to Use this 
Framework
 Supervisors from all 
academic discipline
s and 
level
s of experience will find value in the 
framework. For some it will reassure them that their practice already includes the 

activities of effective supervisors, for others it will set a standard of practice to work 

towards through
out
 their careers.
  
While for
 institutions, often with 
only 
small research supervisor development teams, the 
framework can be used to validate, complement and support their internal development 
programmes.
The Criteria for 
Good Supervisory Practice
 There are numerous definitions of ‚s
upervisory practice™ in the literature (see
, for 
example
, Eley and Murray 2009, Wisker 2012, Grant et al 2014, Kearns and Finn 2017, 
Taylor et al 2018) but 
each 
contain
s all or m
any
 of the 
criteria in the Good Supervisory 
Practice Framework
:  CRITERIA
 FOR 
GOOD SUPERVISORY PRACTICE
  Recruitment and selection
.  Supervisory relationships with candidates
.  Supervisory relationships with co
-supervisors
.  Supporting candidates™ research projects
.  Encouraging candidates to write and giving appropriate feedback
.  Keeping the research on track and monitoring progress
.  Supporting candidates™ personal, professional and career 
development
.  Supporting candidates through completion and final examination
.  Supporting candidates to disseminate their research
.  Reflecting upon and enhancing practice
.  Following Brown and Atkins (1988: 115), ‚good™ practice may be defined as the 
set of 
underpinning attributes
 that make ‚– [supervision] effective.™ On this basis ‚good 
practice™ can be defined as 
the attributes tha
t enable supervisors to be effective
 in each 
of these domains.

 3   Recruitment
 and
 Selection
 Supervisors can be involved in recruitment activities in a number of
 ways, including 
publicising the areas within which they can offer supervision and reaching out to 
under
-represented groups.
 Supervisors should be involved in the selection of candidates from supporting 

intending applicants to develop their applications th
rough to making final decisions 
and giving feedback.
  
   Typical Examples
  Publicising the areas of research within which they personally can 
offer supervision
.  Participating in campaigns to recruit candidates from groups that 
are under
-represented in doct
oral education
.  Assessing whether applicants are likely to make the transition to 
independent
 researchers
.  Assessing whether applicants™ proposed research projects are 
realisable and whether they have (or can acquire) the knowledge 
and skills to complete t
hem
.  Interviewing applicants
.  Making a final decision and giving feedback.
 The following pages provide
 overviews of each attribute
 defining good supervisory 
practice, along with 
typical examples of activities
 that might be found 
in that 
practice.

 4  Supervisory 
Relationships with 
Candidates
 Over the past three decades or so, the candidate population has become much 
more diverse in its composition, and supervisors need to be 
aware of this in forming 
effective relationships with candidates.
 In order to do this, there is a need right from the start for supervisors and doctoral 
candidates to have clear expectations of each other and the first task is to discuss 
these and, where a
ppropriate, negotiate how they are going to be met.
 Also, candidates and supervisors need to be able to work effectively with each 

other. Because each grouping of individuals is, by definition, unique, then each 

relationship will be different depending upo
n the style(s) of the supervisor(s) and 
the characteristics of the candidate, which need to be aligned at the start to be 

successful.
 That said, the relationship can and indeed should change over the course of time.  

As candidates move through their doctor
al studies, their needs should change, and 
with that the nature of support that they require from their supervisors. 
 However, in a few cases, there may be serious issues leading to the potential or 

actual breakdown of the relationship, for which superviso
rs need to be prepared 
and aware of the sources of support both for candidates and themselves.
 Typical 
Examples
  Acknowledging the increased diversity of the 
candidate population 
Š both 
domestic and inter
national 
Š and recognizing its 
implications for supervision
.  Discussing and agreeing expectations with candidates at the start of 
their studies
.  Being aware of supervisory styles and their relationship to s
tudent 
needs and being able to align them at the start of doctoral studies
.  Being aware of how student needs change over the course of 
doctoral studies and being able to maintain calibration of 
supervisory styles
.  Being aware of institutional 
policies and procedures in the event of 
the breakdown of a supervisory relationship and of sources of 
support for both parties

 5  Supervisory
 Relationships with 
Co-Supervisors
 Historically, the model has been for candidates to have a single 
supervisor. But 
more recently there has been a move to co
- or team supervision to enhance the 
experience of doctoral candidates by reducing their reliance upon a single 
individual and giving them access to a broader range of expertise and support.
 However,
 co-supervision can have a downside. The involvement of more 
supervisors in the process can create a potential for disagreement and divergence 

within the team and leave the candidate 
trying to navigate different perspectives 
or advice, to the detriment of their experience.
 Typic
al 
Examples
  Clarifying roles with co
-supervisors and candidates at the start of the 
candidacy
.  Clarifying expectations of the project with co
-supervisors and the 
candidate
.  Regularly reviewing relations between supervisors and with 
candidates during the course of the candidacy
.  Supporting 
Candidates™ 
Research 
Projects
 New doctoral candidates may have little or no experience of research, and hence 
little or no idea of what 
they are letting themselves in for. Supervisors may then 
need to induct them into research, including the nature of research itself, the key 

concepts, what it involves, and of good practice in undertaking it.
 Unless the research project itself is pre
-deter
mined, supervisors will have a role in 
advising candidates about their choice of topic and then assisting them to produce 

a research proposal and to gain ethical approval. Irrespective of the discipline, 
supervisors will need to make sure that candidates h
ave, or can acquire, the 
subject
-specific knowledge and skills necessary for them to undertake their 
research topics. These may include the relevant experimental and technological 
skills to undertake their research projects, in the latter case including in
formation 
searching, retrieval, storage, and sharing, 
 If, in these ways, candidates can be started down the slipway, sooner or later they 
are almost bound to encounter academic problems of one kind or another. It is 
important that, if and when this happen
s, supervisors are aware and lend support.

 6  Typical 
Examples
  Discussing conceptions and misconceptions of research itself with 
candidates
.  Looking at key ‚threshold™ concepts in research
.  Considering issues of academic integrity, intellectual property right
s, 
and co
-publication
.  Advising on a choice of topic
.  Advising on a research proposal and plan
.  Supporting the candidate in their choice of methodology
.  Advising on gaining ethical approval
.  Advising on skills development in relation to the project
.  Advising on issues arising in the course of the research.
  Encouraging 
Candidates to 
Write and 
Giving 
Appropriate 
Feedback
 Candidates need to produce written work throughout their studies to articulate 
what they are thinking, to reflect upon their findin
gs, and to gain feedback. But 
candidates may prove reluctant to write particularly in the early stages and need 
encouragement and support from their supervisors to do so.
 Once they have produced written work, supervisors have to give feedback. It is 

import
ant that feedback is high
-quality and that it enables candidates to progress 
their research projects
. Typical 
Examples
  Encouraging candidates to write from the start of their studies
.  Supporting the development of academic writing
.  Giving timely, 
constructive, and actionable feedback.

 7  Keeping the 
Research on
 Track and 
Monitoring 
Progress
 The days when, because they involved the creation of new knowledge, doctoral 
degrees took as long as they took are long gone. Globally, research sponsors have 
put policies in place designed to ensure that candidates to complete their degrees 
in three or four years of full
-time study (or pro rata for part
-time). Such policies 
have usually entailed financial penalties for departments and/or institutions which 

have 
failed to hit targets for completion rates and/or times.
 In consequence, over the past three decades or so, one of, if not the, the key roles 
for supervisors have become ensuring as far as possible that candidates complete 
on time.
 Typical 
Examples
  Supporting and motivating candidates to progress in their studies
.  Using supervisions to monitor progress
.  Participating in formal progression events
. Supporting 
Candidates™ 
Personal,
 Professional and 
Career 
Development
 Doctoral candidates are, of course
, people and as such subject to ups and downs in 
their personal lives. Supervisors need at least to be aware of such issues and help 

candidates to be aware of the relevant professional services. They also need to 

recognise that they may be role model for t
heir candidates, including in achieving 
a work
-life balance.
 Supervisors also have a responsibility to support the professional development of 
doctoral candidates in terms of socialization within their disciplinary community 
and, where appropriate, in unde
rtaking teaching duties in the subject.
 Traditionally, such activities helped to support doctoral candidates to prepare for 

academic careers, and supervisors have had a direct role in informing them about 

faculty work and life. In recent years, however, on
ly a minority of doctoral 
graduates have become academics, while the majority have found employment in 

other spheres. Here, supervisors may have an indirect role in supporting candidates 
to prepare for non
-academic careers

 8  Typical 
Examples
  Acting in a 
pastoral capacity with doctoral candidates
.  Being good role models in terms of work
-life balance
.  Inducting candidates into disciplinary networks and activities
.  Supporting their development as teachers
.  Informing them about academic careers
.  Supporting th
e development of employment
-related skills
.  Supporting 
Candidates 
Through 
Completion and 
Final 
Examination
 Once candidates have substantially finished their research projects, they have to 
produce a submission, usually but not always a thesis. This is likely to be the longest 
and most difficult piece of work that a candidate has ever undertaken, and 

supervisors
 have a key role in supporting them to complete their submissions.
 Once candidates have a complete draft, the next issue is whether they should 

submit it for the degree. While of course there are no guarantees, supervisors need 
to be able to advise candida
tes as to the likelihood of the thesis passing, for which 
they need a clear understanding of the criteria for the award. 
 In order to support the examination process, it is important that supervisors have 

a knowledge and understanding of how research degre
es are examined, including 
criteria for the appointment of examiners, examination policies and processes, and 
outcomes.
 In most but not all higher education systems, the examination will involve an 

assessment of the written submission plus an oral examinat
ion. Candidates may be 
unfamiliar with oral examinations and one role of supervisors can be to help 
prepare them for their viva.
 In many countries, supervisors are debarred from examining their own protégés, 

and while they may sit in they play no role in the examination itself. Where 
examiners refer submissions, supervisors may have a role afterwards in terms of 
supporting candidate
s to revise their work.

 9  Typical 
Examples
  Working with candidates to finalise their submissions
.  Advising them on whether the thesis is likely to pass on the basis of your 
experience as an examiner.
  Roles in appointing examiners
.  Understanding of relevant policies and procedures and outcomes
.  Supporting candidates to prepare for the viva
.  Supporting c
andidates after the viva
.  Supporting 
Candidates to 
Disseminate their 
Research
 Giving that completing a doctorate involves making and original contribution to 
knowledge and understanding, it is vital that the outcomes are made available to 
the disciplinar
y and/or professional community for scrutiny and the advancement 

of research in the subject. One responsibility of supervisors is to support candidates 
to disseminate their research findings.
 Typical 
Examples
  Setting expectations at the start of the 
candidacy
.  Modelling the process of publication
.  Encouraging candidates to publish as they go
.  Co-publishing
.  Establishing a post
-doctoral publications plan.

 10  Reflecting 
Upon and 
Enhancing 
Practice
 If supervisors are to improve their practice, they need 
to evaluate it, reflect upon 
it, determine their strengths and weaknesses, build upon the former and address 
the latter.
 As with other areas of academic practice, supervisors should undertake 
appropriate professional development to enhance their practice, 
which may 
include workshops and programmes as well as familiarity with the scholarly 

literature and its implications for practice.
 Where supervisors identify good practice, then wherever possible they should 

disseminate it for the benefit of others.
 Typical 
Examples
  Using an appropriate mix of methods for evaluating supervision
.  Undertaking initial and continuing professional development
.  Familiarity with the scholarly literature.
  Where appropriate, contributing to the professional 
development of 
other supervisors
