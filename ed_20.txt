Researcher 
Development 
Statement 


The 
UK 
is 
committed 
to 
enhancing 
the 
higher-level 
capabilities 
of 
the 
UK 
workforce 
including 
the 
development 
of 
world-class 
researchers. 
Researchers 
are 
critical 
to 
economic 
success, 
addressing 
major 
global 
challenges, 
and 
building 
a 
leading 
knowledge 
economy. 


The 
Researcher 
Development 
Statement 
(RDS) 
sets 
out 
the 
knowledge, 
behaviours 
and 
attributes 
of 
effective 
and 
highly 
skilled 
researchers 
appropriate 
for 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
careers. 


The 
RDS 
is 
for 
policy 
makers 
and 
research 
organisations 
which 
provide 
personal, 
professional 
and 
career 
development 
for 
researchers 
in 
higher 
education. 


The 
Researcher 
Development 
Statement 
is 
derived 
from 
the 
Researcher 
Development 
Framework 
(RDF), 
a 
major 
new 
approach 
to 
researcher 
development, 
which 
aims 
to 
enhance 
our 
capacity 
to 
build 
the 
UK 
workforce, 
develop 
world-class 
researchers 
and 
build 
our 
research 
base. 


The 
RDS 
and 
RDF 
will 
contribute 
to 
researcher 
training 
and 
development 
in 
the 
UK 
by 
providing 
a 
strategic 
statement 
(RDS) 
and 
operational 
framework 
(RDF) 
to 
support 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Concordat 
to 
Support 
the 
Career 
Development 
of 
Researchers1, 
the 
QAA 
Code 
of 
practice 
for 
research 
degree 
programmes2 
and 
the 
‘Roberts’3 
recommendations 
for 
postgraduate 
researchers 
and 
research 
staff. 


1www.researchconcordat.ac.uk 
2www.qaa.ac.uk 


The 
RDS 
is 
structured 
in 
four 
domains 
encompassing 
the 
knowledge, 
intellectual 
abilities, 
techniques 
and 
professional 
standards 
to 
do 
research, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
personal 
qualities, 
knowledge 
and 
skills 
to 
work 
with 
others 
and 
ensure 
the 
wider 
impact 
of 
research. 
Within 
each 
of 
the 
domains 
are 
three 
sub-domains 
and 
associated 
descriptors, 
which 
describe 
different 
aspects 
of 
being 
a 
researcher. 


The 
Researcher 
Development 
Statement 
is 
an 
evolution 
of 
the 
Research 
Councils’ 
Joint 
Skills 
Statement 
(JSS)4 
and 
replaces 
the 
JSS 
as 
the 
key 
reference 
statement 
for 
the 
development 
of 
postgraduate 
researchers’ 
skills 
and 
attributes 
and 
researchers 
employed 
in 
higher 
education. 
All 
the 
skills 
and 
attributes 
of 
the 
JSS 
have 
been 
incorporated 
into 
the 
RDS 
and 
their 
distribution 
is 
identified 
in 
the 
table 
below. 
A 
two-way 
mapping 
of 
the 
RDS 
and 
the 
JSS 
is 
available 
on 
the 
RDF 
section 
of 
the 
Vitae 
website.
