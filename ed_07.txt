Extensions to Period of Study 
 
 
 
(1)
 
The Regulations for research degrees divide the total period of 
registration for the degree into two parts 

 
the Period of Study and the 
Registration
-
Only period (see section 
7a
 
of the 
Code of Practice for 
Research Degrees
). The expectation is that research degree 
candidates should have completed their research by the end of the 
Period of Study. If it becomes apparent that resea
rch will not be 
completed by the end of the 
P
eriod of 
S
tudy
, 
then an extension to the 
Period 
of 
Study 
should be sought. 
The Regulations
 
for 
the particular 
research degree
 
should be c
onsulted
 
to 
check
 
whether approval 
of an 
extension 
is pe
rmit
ted by
 
Schools/Institutes 
or whether this requires the 
approval of t
he 
Academic Director of UEA Doctoral College
.

Extensions to Registration
-
only Periods
 
 
(1)
 
If the thesis has not been submitted by the end of the Period of Study 
t
he Regulations
 
for some research degrees 
include
 
a Registration
-
Only 
period within which the candidate will complete the writing up of the 
t
hesis and submit. The approval of the 
Academic Director of UEA 
Doctoral College
 
will be required if the need for an extension emerges 
during the period of 
Registration
-
O
nly. 
 
 
(2)
 
For research degree candidates on a combined 
P
eriod of 
S
tudy and 
registration
 
i.
e. with no 
Registration
-
Only period, any extensions 
during 
the 
approved 
P
eriod of 
S
tudy and registration should be 
considered
 
as 
extensions to the 
P
eriod of 
S
tudy, not the 
P
eriod of 
R
egistration.
 
 
(3)
 
The 
Academic Director of UEA Doctoral College
, acting on behalf of 
the 
Learning and Teaching Committee will consider
 
applications for 
extensions to 
R
egistration
-
O
nly periods from 
research degree 
candidates, endorsed by their supervisory panel and recommended by 
the Head of School or their nominee
 
(wh
o will normally be the 
School/Institute Director of Postgraduate Research)
.

(4)
 
Applications should be submitted on a form (copies available from
 
the 
Postgraduate Re
search Service
 
website
) the relevant sections of which 
must be completed and returned by candidates
 
along with any 
supporting documentation and an up to date Completion Plan for their 
thesis 
at least three months
 
before the expiry of their current 
submissi
on deadline. Deadlines for submission are normally the last 
day of a quarter; i.e. 30 September, 31 December, 31 March or 30 
June. 
Retrospective requests should be avoided wherever possible, 
particularly where 
candidates
 
are funded by Research Councils 
or 
other 
external 
fund
ers
 
who require 
prompt
 
notification of delay
s
 
in 
progress.
 
 
 
(5)
 
Applications for extensions will not be considered
 
unless candidates 
have paid the continuation fee (if any) for their current 
P
eriod of 
R
egistration. 
 
 
 
(6)
 
Applications from candidates must be endorsed by their supervisory 
team
, and that endorsement must be based on direct knowledge of the 
progress of the thesis. The application should be 
sent to 
the 
Postgraduate 
Research Service
 
at least three months before the expiry 
of the current deadline
. The Postgraduate Research Service will then 
submit
 
the application 
to the School 
/ Institute 
Director of Postgraduate 
Research for consideration
, before forwarding t
he comple
ted 

to 
the 
Academic Director of UEA Doctoral College
.
 
 
 
 
(7)
 
Where there is evidence that the candidate has made reasonable 
progress, shows a continuing commitment to work on the thesis, and 
can show good
 
reason for the delay in submission beyond the normal 
deadline the 
Academic Director of UEA Doctoral College
 
will normally 
be prepared to consider an extension to the 
P
eriod of 
R
egistration of 
not more than six months at a time. Extensions for more than si
x 
months will normally be agreed subject to confirmation that satisfactory 
progress has been made after the first six months. Guidance regarding 
good reason for an extension is provided below. 
 
 
 
(8)
 
Applications for extensions must be accompanied by a realist
ic 
schedule for completion of the 
thesis
, incorporating regular 
assessments of progress.  
 
 
(9)
 
The 
Academic Director of UEA Doctoral College
 
decision will be 
communicated to the candidate, 
via
 
the 
email 
address
(es)
 
given on the 
application form, by the Postgr
aduate Research Service. If the 
extension is 
likely 
to be the final one which the 
Academic Director
 
is 
p
repared to grant, then this will be clearly stated in the letter. Where 
the extension granted is not stated to be the final one then candidates 
may requ
est a further extension but they should expect the 
Academic 
Director
 
to be less sympathetic on any subsequent occasion.

(10)
 
Where the extension is 
likely to be 
the final one which the 
Academic 
Director
 
is prepared to grant, 
it is good practice for 
the School / Institute 
Director of Postgraduate Research to confirm this to the 
candidate
 
and 
primary
 
supervisor at a private meeting. 
 
 
 
(11)
 
Candidates who fail to submit their thesis by the submission deadline 
and who have not request
ed an extension will be deemed to have 
withdrawn their candidature for the degree. They will not subsequently 
be permitted to present a thesis unless formally re
-
admitted. 
 
 
3.
 
Guidance regarding Good Reason for an Extension to 
Registration
-
only
 
Period
 
 
 
 
(1)
 
The reasons for seeking an extension should be unforeseen and 
unavoidable circumstances, for which the 
candidate
 
could not have 
been prepared, and which are judged sufficiently severe to hinder the 
progress of study. 
 
 
 
Such cir
cumstances might include evidence of: 
 
a)
 
prolonged ill
-
health; 
 
b)
 
significant adverse personal or family 
circumstances; 
 
c)
 
unforeseen obstruction of access for data collection or 
analysis. 
 
 
(2)
 
Uncorroborated claims of ill
-
health will not normally be acceptable 
gro
unds for an extension.  
 
 
(3)
 
An extension to 
the 
P
eriod of 
S
tudy or 
R
egistration may be an 
appropriate reasonable adjustment under the terms of the Equality Act 
for a 
candidate
 
with a disability
 
or long
-
term health condition
.
 
 
 
(4)
 
Requests for extensions 
are likely to 
be treated less sympathetically
 
where c
hanges to personal circumstances 
are 
knowingly entered into
 
or 
where 
the
 
candidate 
has 
demonstrated
 
poor academic practice
 
or 
time management
. This might include:
  
 
a)
 
suspending the 
Period 
of 
Study 
to enter employment; 
 
b)
 
the need to find employment during the
 
R
egistration
-
O
nly 
period; 
 
c)
 
disruption caused by a voluntary change of job (unless 
the 
candidate
 
is registered part
-
time, in which case 
discretion may be exercised)
;
 
 
d)
 
poor standard of English in the thesis draft and/or delays 
in proof
-
reading
;
 
e)
 
loss of data
 
or notes which should have been backed up.

4.
 
Other Amendments to Period of Registration or Period of Study
 
 
 
 
The principle that circumstances should be unforeseen or unavoidable will 
also be applied by the 
University
 
to the consideration of other reques
ts to 
amend the 
P
eriod of 
S
tudy or 
P
eriod of 
R
egistration (for example, requests to 
interrupt 
during the 
P
eriod of 
S
tudy, to interrupt the 
P
eriod of 
R
egistration or 
extend the 
P
eriod of 
S
tudy). Requests based on circumstances which are 
neither 
unforeseen nor unavoidable will be considered on the merits of the 
case.
