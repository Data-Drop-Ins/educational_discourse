External Examiner System
 
 
Purposes and Functions
 
 
3.1
 
The purposes of the external examiner system are to ensure that
 
qualifications awarded in similar subjects are comparable in standard in
 
all universities in the United Kingdom, though the criteria for research
 
degree awards may vary; and that the assessmen
t system is fair and
 
fairly operated for 
research degree candidates.
 
 
3.2
 
In order to achieve these purposes, external examiners need to be
 
able:
 
a)
 
to participate in the assessment process for University awards
 
b)
 
to comment and give advice on programmes of study a
nd on the
 
assessment process.
 
 
Formal Requirements
 
 
3.3
 
External examiners are responsible to the Senate, which authorises the
 
award of University qualifications.
 
 
3.4
 
No University qualification will be awarded without the participation in
 
the examining process o
f at least one examiner external to the
 
University.
 
 
3.5
 
Each external examiner on appointment will be sent a written
 
statement 
about the Regulations and Instructions to Examiners
 
concerning the 
particular research degree programme, explaining the
 
role and 
fun
ctions of external examiners as seen by the University and
 
by the 
particular School.

Appointment 
of Examiners 
and Frequency of Service
 
 
4.1
 
 
The
 
Faculty Associate Dean 
(Postgraduate Research) 
approves, on
 
behalf of the
 
Doctoral College
 
Executive
, the 
appointment of examiners 
on the recommendation of
 
Heads 
of
 
Schools or 
their nominees
. It is
 
expected that Schools
 
/ Institutes
 
will make informal contact with 
examiners to
 
check their availability before recommending their 
appointment.

4.2
 
It is a 
requirement of the Regulations that recommendations for
 
examiners shall normally be made 
not later than three months
 
before the expected date of the submission of the thesis
. This
 
ensures that the examination process can start immediately on
 
submission of the thesis.
 
 
4.3
 
The 
Head 
of School
 
or nominee 
shall recommend for approval the 
names of
 
two or more examiners, at least one of whom shall be an 
external
 
examiner.
 
 
4.4
 
A 
candidate

 
team will not
 
be appointed as an internal examiner.
 
 
4.5
 
The examination of any Category A 
candidates
 
(see 
Section 
6
 
of the 
UEA
 
Code of Practi
ce: Research Degrees
) employed
 
by the University 
or Institute for a research degree shall be conducted
 
exclusively by 
external examiners, supported by the appointment of an
 
Independent 
Chair 

 
procedures.
 
 
4.6
 
External examiners will not be appointed to act more than three times
 
in four years without explicit permission from the 
Academic Director of 
UEA Doctoral College
, acting on behalf of the 
Doctoral College
 
Executive
. Exceptions may, however, oc
casionally be
 
unavoidable in 
the case of a limited number of experts in the subject
 
area.
 
 
4.7
 
Recommendations for appointment should be made on the appropriate
 
form provided by 
the 
Postgraduate Research Service
.
 
 
4.8
 
After the 
Faculty Associate Dean 
(Postgraduate Research) 
or 
Academic Director of UEA Doctoral College
 
in 
the case of
 
Category A 
candidates
,
 
 
has approved the
 
appointment of examiners a formal letter 
will be sent 
to the external examiner which is copied to the
 
internal 

 
 
4.9
 
The University expects External Examiners to act within, and for their 
actions and behaviour to reflect the spirit of, this framework at all times. 
Where the University believes this not to be the case, it will notify the 
External Examiner in writing that 
their term as External Examiner be 
brought to an end.

For all examiner
 
appointments
 
 
a)
 
Only research
-
active persons 
with
 
sufficient standing, 
credibility, 
and 
relevant 
experience and 
expertise in the area of research 
being examined 
will be appointed.
 
 
 
b)
 
Guidance and advice on 
regulatory and procedural matters will 
be provided by the School / Institute Director of Postgraduate 
Research, who will be available to brief the examiner(s) and 
respond to queries prior to the oral examination. In particular, 
Schools 
/ Institutes must
 
en
sure that appropriate support is 
provided to examiners who have examined fewer than two UK 
research degrees in the past three years 
and
 
those from outside 
the UK University system.   
 
 
c)
 

titles, t
itle of current post and, for the external examiner, the 
contact address and any additional details as described 
below
.
 
 
For external examiner
s
 
 
d)
 
Requests for appointment of external examiners should be
 
accompanied by a
 
curriculum vitae for the nominee in order
 
for 
the
 
Faculty
 
Associate Dean 
(Postgraduate Research)
 
to satisfy 
themselves 
about
 
the seniority, experience and, where 
appropriate, the particular
 
expertise of appointed examiners. 
This should include details of
 
the length of time the person has 
been in post, previous
 
experience of examining at research 
degree level in the UK, and
 
details of expertise in the particular 
field.
 
 
e)
 
Former members of staff will not normally be invited to become 
external examiners before
 
a lapse of at least three years, or 
sufficient time for students taught or supervised by that member 
of staff to have left the University, whichever is the longer.
 
 
f)
 
Proposed external examiners who have been involved in 
collaborative research with the cand
idate, the proposed internal 
examiner or any member of the supervisory team within the past 
three years or who have published jointly with the candidate, 
internal examiner or the supervisory team within the past three 
years will not be appointed. A close p
ersonal or working 
relationship between the proposed external examiner and any 
member of the supervisory team, the proposed internal 
examiner or the candidate could compromise the external 
perception of the integrity of the assessment process and should 
be
 
avoided.

g)
 
Individuals holding honorary appointments within the University 
may not act as external examiners. Such individuals may be 
considered for appointment as an internal examiner.
 
 
h)
 
The 
Doctoral College
 
Executive is normally 
only prepared to 
appoint examiners from overseas if there is no suitable 
UK
 
appointee or if the overseas examiner happens to be in the 
United Kingdom for some other purpose.
 
 
i)
 
Where making recommendations for external examiners who 
have retired as 
academics from other universities more than 
three years previously, Heads of School (or nominee) should 
provide evidence that the proposed examiner has kept up, not 
only with the subject of study professed, but also wi
th university 
standards, by examining 
elsewhere, regular university teaching, 
etc.
 
 
For internal examiner
s
 
 
j)
 
Academic staff in their probationary period will not normally be
 
appointed as the sole internal examiner. Where a member of
 
academic staff is examining for the first time 
as an internal 
examiner under the UK examining system
, they 
are required to 
attend the appropriate programme of development for new 
examiners 
or
 
an Independent Chair should be appointed for the 
oral examination. 
 
 
k)
 
Any proposed internal exam
iner must have experience as a 
primary or second supervisor o
f supporting a research degree 
candidate through to successful c
ompletion or previous research 
degree examination experience. 
 
 
 
l)
 
Individuals who have recently retired as members of academic
 
staff
 
from the University (within three years) may be nominated
 
to act as internal examiners.
 
 
m)
 
Proposed 
internal
 
examiners who have been involved in 
collaborative research or who have published jointly with the 
candidate
 
or 
the proposed 
ex
ternal examiner
 
within
 
the past 
three years will not be appointed. A close personal or working 
relationship between the proposed 
inter
nal examiner and the 
candidate 
or 
the proposed external examiner 
could compromise 
the external perception of the integrity of the assessment 
pro
cess and should be avoided.

Examiners have the responsibility of identifying
 
and notifying the 
University of
 
potential conflicts of
 
interest involving their appointment.

Conflict of interest 
 
 
 
6.1  
 
To ensure independence of the examination process, an examiner 
should not be nominated if there is the potential for a conflict of interest 
with the candidate, supervisor, University, subject matter or with 
another examiner. There are a range of circumstan
ces which have the 
potential to introduce bias and compromise the independence of the 
examination. It is important to note that there may be situations in 
which the appearance of conflict of interest is present even when no 
conflict actually exists. Theref
ore, it is important when evaluating a 
potential conflict of interest to consider how it might be perceived by 
Postgraduate Research Service                     Page

others, that is, would a reasonable person consider it likely to 
compromise objectivity.   
 
 
6.2  
 
In dealing with potential conflicts of interes
t it is important to: 
 
 
 

 
Distinguish between major conflicts which generally result in non
-
appointment of the examiner, and minor conflicts which should be 
declared and explained, but do not necessarily inhibit the examiner's 
independence; and 
 
 
 

 
Consider mitigating factors associated with conflicts of interest arising 
from collaboration on publ
ications and/or research grants. The size of 
the team or the relative independence of some members could mean
 
there is minimal direct collaboration with the proposed examiner(s). In 
smaller Schools / research areas some degree of research 
collaboration and
 
joint publication between the internal examiner and 
supervisory team may be unavoidable. 
 
 
 
6.3  
 
Some (non
-
exhaustive) examples of potential sources of conflict of 
interest are provided below: 
 
 
 


research, for example as a previous member of the supervisory team, 
or by direct and sustained input/advice into the work being examined
.
 
 
 
 
b) A proposed examiner is related to the candidate, supervisor or other 
nominated examiner or they have a
n existing or a previous close 
personal relationship. 
 
 
 
c) A close professional or financial relationship between the proposed 
examiner and the candidate, supervisor or other nominated examiner. 
 
 
 
d) A proposed examiner having a direct commercial interes
t in the 
outcomes of the research
.
 
 
 
 
e) A proposed examiner was a student of the supervisor in the last five 
years
.
 
 
 
 
f) A proposed examiner has published work critical of the candidate's 
approach (naming the candidate/supervisor).
 
 
6.4 
 
If there is any 
uncertainty as to whether there is a conflict of interest, or 
if an individual is uncertain about how it might affect their participation 
in the examination process, they should contact the School / Institute 
Director 
of 
Postgraduate Research.

examine. The Instructions are to be read in conjunction with 
the
 
Regulations for the degree
.
 
 
7
.2
 
The Instructions set out the criteria for decision
-
making, the purpose
 
and nature of the examination, the recommendations available to the
 
examiners, and details of the nature of the report
s
 
to be provided.
 
 
7
.3
 
Supervisors will not 
normally be permitted to 
attend 
the
 
oral 
examination.
 
However 
the examiners may 
invite the Primary Supervisor 
to attend 
at the end of the oral examination 
when the
ir
 
recommendation 
is communicated 
to the candidate
.
  
 
 
7
.4
 
Where an
 
Independent Chair
 
is appointed, they 
shall 
attend
 
and remain 
present for the duration of the oral examination, as well as the post
-
examination decision making
, but will 
not participate in the questioning 
of
 
the candidate or the decision making itself
.
 
 
7
.5
 
A candidate shall be examined orally on the thesis and on subjects
 
relevant to it. In exceptional circumstances the 
Academic Director of 
UEA Doctoral College
 
may, on sufficient grounds submitted by the
 
can
didate and their 
s
upervisory 
t
eam, with the agreement of the 
examiners and on the recommendation of the H
ead 
o
f 
S
chool
, 
waive 
the requirement for 
the oral examination or agree to
 
its replacement by 
a
n alternative form of assessment
.
 
 
7
.6
 
Prior to the oral examination 
e
ach examiner shall submit an 
independent 
preliminary
 
report to the 
Head
 
of School 
(or nominee) 
using the pro
-
forma supplied by 
the Postgraduate Research Service
. 
The preliminary reports include
 

 
initial impression of 
the submitted work
, 
any particular strengths 
and/
or
 
areas of concern
 
identified in the thesis, and 
issues which the examiner wishes 
to 
explore in the oral examination. 
 
 
7
.7
 
Following the oral examination the examiners shall complete a joint 
final 
report, using the pro
-
forma supplied by 
the Postgraduate 
Research Service
. In exceptional circumstances 
where the examiners 
are unable 
to reach agreement in the recommendation and r
eport, the 
examiners should submit separate independent final reports. 
The 
report format seeks
 

performance, but examiners are
 
invited to make any comments they 
wish, including comments on
 
comparability against standards
 
in other 
research
-
led universities and
 

aims. The report should 
contain
 
any
 
instructions regarding changes to 
the thesis where an examiner
 
requires changes to be made. Examiners 
should note that the report
 
will be made
 
available to the 
candidate
 
and 
supervisory team.
