R
esearch Ethical Approval Framework
 
 
The ethical conduct of research undertaken by UEA staff and students is managed 
at four levels.
 
 
Firstly, staff and students undertaking research that involves human subjects, human 
tissues, animals or animal tissue are encouraged to ask themselves a series of 
questions on the impact of their proposed research.
 
 
Secondly, Heads of Schools in approvin
g any application for research and Course 
Directors and Supervisors in approving any research project, consider those 
questions with the individual student or member of staff and confirm whether or not 
the advice of a Research Ethics Committee should be so
ught. Approval of the 
research project will be dealt with at a later stage, as necessary.
 
 
Thirdly, where ethical consideration is required, research proposals are referred
 
to a 
Research Ethics Committee, which may be subject
-
based or Faculty
-
based. Each 
Research Ethics Committee determines if it has the expertise to consider whether 
ethical approval is required. If not, the proposal is either referred on to a more 
appropria
te committee or the committee 
co
-
opts
 
experienced researchers in that 
field to help consider that individual proposal. In considering a research proposal, 
each Research Ethics Committee has the power to approve, refer back for 
modification or disallow the 
proposed research.
 
 
At the fourth level, the 
University Research Ethics Committee
 
meets regularly to 
monitor the work of the individ
ual committees, share best practice and take on board 
new professional or legal requirements. Annually, a combined report on the work of 

Research Executive.
