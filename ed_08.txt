Approval of New Research Degree Awards or 
Changes to Research Degree Programmes
 
 
1.
 
Introduction
 
 
1.1
 
The approval process for new research degree programmes 
and changes to 
existing provision 
aims to ensure that the quality and standards of research 
degree programmes are maintained
 
and that they comply with the wider 
research agenda of the University. An additional aim is to ensure consistency 
of practice across the University in its approval of award
-
bearing programmes 
and to enable the University to identify and share areas of goo
d practice.
 
 
An application for the approval of a new research degree programme 
will be 
required 
if:
 
 

 
a new research degree programme is proposed, such as a new 
professional doctorate
, 
in the absence of current provision
 

 
amendment
s are proposed 
that make a
 
significant change to the market, 
viability or educational purpose of an existing research degree programme
 

 
an alternative mode of delivery of an existing programme is proposed
.
 
 
1.
2.
 

research degrees 
should be 
consulted when 
the development of any new research degree programme is proposed. 
A list 
of approved research degree prog
r
ammes can be found 
in the 
University 
Calendar
.
 
 
Any new proposal or an amendment to existing provision will be considered in 
relation to:  
 
 
 

 
Th
e 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 
The complementarity of the proposal in relation to other 
current or planned 
provi
sion leading to an award of the University
.

In th
is document
, unless explicitly stated otherwise, Head of School may be 
taken to refer also to the Chair of the NBI Graduate School Executive for 
research degree programmes
 
wholly or primarily 
based 
in the Norwich 
Bioscience Institutes.

Approval Process
 
 
2.1
 
The Academic Lead
 
for the proposal
 
should consult with the Head of the 
Postgraduate Research Service prior to starting the course approval process
 
for information on early considerations and t
imescales
,
 
and to assign a 
Postgraduate Research 
(PGR) 
Officer/Manager to provide advice on 
completing the 
necessary documentation. 
If 
the proposal is for 
a new 
degree 
award 
not previously
 
offered by the School/
Institute
1
/
University, 
this should be 
flagged to the Finance, Governance and Planning Office at an early stage. 
 
 
2.2
.
 
The 
approval 
process is staged and risk
-
based. 
The approval for 
Low Risk
 
proposals is devolved to 
Faculty 
Graduate School Executives
,
 
differing from 
the approval of 
Standard Risk
 
proposals which are usually accompanied by a 
business case and financial plan and where more widespread consultation 
and sign
-
off by the University

 
Learning and Teaching Committee is required. 
 
 
2.3
 
The initi
al idea is articulated in the 
Course Proposal Outline
 
(CP1R
)
,
 
and once 
that has School
/Institute
 
approval, the next stages can commence. Course 
Approval forms, for use for both new 
research degree programmes
 
and 
changes to existing 
programmes
, are available from the 
Postgraduate 
Research Service
 
website
.

Approval of a new research degree programme 
or amendmen
ts to an existing 
programme will 
consist of 
up to three 
stages. The stage or stages of the 
approval process that are applicable will depend on the 
level of risk 
determined.
 
Guidance and full details are incorporated within the 
approval 
forms themselves. 
St
age 
1
 
(
Course Proposal Outline
) is n
ecessary 
for all 
applications. 
Stage 
2 (
Business Case
 
and 
Financial Plan
)
 
is only required for 
proposals designated as 
standard risk
. 
Stage 3 
(
Academic Design
)
 
is required 
for 
all standard risk 
proposals 
and for low risk proposals where 
the academic 
content
 
(including research environment)
 
is changing
.

.
 
Risk Categories
 
 
The 
Faculty 
Associate Dean 
for 
Postgraduate Research
 
responsible 
for the 
School
 
where the proposal originates
 
will 
assign the 
level of risk in 
consultation with the PGR Officer / Manager
 
as follows
:
 
 
 
3
.1
 
Category One 

 
Existing Content (Low risk proposals)
 
 

typically 
will 
involve changes to
 
existing provision 
and
 
therefore
 
the quality assurance risk is low, 
and there is no financial impact so 
the financial risk is low. 
If the proposal is for existing applicants and/or 
students, these groups 
may 
need to be consulted with 
in line with consumer 
rights legislation 
and evidence of the consultation provided; please seek 
further advice from 
the PGR Service
 
if necessary. 
Examples of 
low risk 
categories
 
are given below
:

The use of the term Institutes in this document refers to the John Innes Centre, The Sainsbury L
aboratory, the 
Earlham Institute and the Quadram Institute Bioscience.
