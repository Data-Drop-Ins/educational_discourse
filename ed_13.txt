Continuation Fees
 
 
 
1.
 
The 
P
eriod of 
S
tudy for a research degree is the time in which the work 
for the degree is undertaken and in which it is desirable that the thesis be 
submitted. Research should have been completed by the end of the 
P
eriod of 
S
tudy. If the thesis has not been submitted by 
the end of the 
P
eriod of 
S
tudy the 
R
egulations for some research degrees permit one 
more year within which to complete and submit, as set out in Section 
7
 
of 
the 
Code of Practice
 
for
 
Research Degrees
. Continuation fees are 
payable for this 
R
egistration

nly year, and any subsequent years of 
R
egistration
-
O
nly, in accordance with the policy set out below

candidates will be liable for

fees in accordance with paragraph 11 
of the 
Fees Regulations in the Academic Calendar
.
 
These are typically 
much 
higher than continuation fees.

Exemptions
 
 
The 
Academic Director of UEA Doctoral College
 
may make a case to the 

c
ontinuation 
f
ees in 
accordance with paragraph 12 of the 
Fees Regulations
 
where it is evident 
that the extension has resulted from prolonged serious illness
 
or 

. Such a case will not 
be made unless exceptional circumstances can be demonstrated and 
supervisors and 
candidates 
should be fully aware of the fee implications 
of making an extension request. The final 
decision on exemption from 
continuation 
fees rests with the Fees Officer.
 
 
 
7.
 
Why is timely submission important?
 
 
The purpose of continuation fees is to provide an inducement to 
research degree candidates 
to submit their thesis. Timely submission of 
a 
thesis is desirable for the
 
following reasons:
 
 
a)
 
A 

a
 
properly designed and executed project should be capable of
 
completion within the time allowed in 
the Regulations
.
 
 
b)
 
For 
candidates 
on 
funded studentships, funded extensions are
 
unlikely and 
this may have serious consequences for their 
personal finances
.
 
 
c)
 
Ca
ndidates 
without any deadline might, after the completion of their 
P
eriod of 
S
tudy, gradually allow their thesis to take a falling priority 
in the face of the demands of their job
 
or 
other commitments, with 
the end result that it is abandoned 
uncompleted
.
 
 
d)
 
Thesis 
s
ubmission and completion rates are a key indicator for 
external
 
funding agencies deciding whether to allocate studentships to 
the
 
University. The past record of a School's
 

 
submission rates is examined
 
against set ta
rgets. Where a School 
does not meet these targets, a
 
funding agency 
is likely to 
apply 
penalties against the School in the form of a
 
reduction in the number of 
studentships.
